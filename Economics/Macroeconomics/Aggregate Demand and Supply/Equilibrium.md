Economic equilibrium is a state in which market forces are balanced, a condition that, in the absence of external influences, the values of economic variables will not change. It is a central concept in economics, particularly in the analysis of markets and the behavior of economic agents.

#### Definition:

Economic equilibrium occurs when supply equals demand for a good or service, resulting in an equilibrium price and quantity. In perfectly competitive markets, this is where the quantity demanded by consumers equals the quantity supplied by producers.

#### Explanation:

Economic equilibrium can be seen in various market structures, including perfect competition and monopolies. In perfect competition, the equilibrium price is established through competition, ensuring the amount of goods or services sought by buyers is equal to the amount produced by sellers. In monopolies, the equilibrium is determined by the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost.

#### Examples:

- In a competitive market for a product like apples, equilibrium is reached when the amount of apples consumers want to buy at a certain price is equal to the amount farmers are willing to sell.
- In a monopoly, the equilibrium price and quantity are set where the monopolistâ€™s marginal revenue equals its marginal cost, which is typically at a lower quantity and higher price than in a competitive market.

#### Properties:

Equilibrium in economics has three basic properties as proposed by Huw Dixon:

1. Supply equals demand (Property P1).
2. No agent has an incentive to change their behavior (Property P2).
3. The equilibrium is stable; if disturbed, the market will return to the equilibrium (Property P3).

#### Applications:

Understanding economic equilibrium helps predict how changes in supply and demand can affect price and quantity in the market. It is also used to analyze the efficiency of markets and the impact of economic policies.
