Aggregate supply (AS) is a fundamental concept in macroeconomics that represents the total supply of goods and services that firms in a national economy plan to sell during a specific time period. It is closely related to the production capacity of the economy and is influenced by various factors, including the price level, input costs, and government policies.

### Definition

Aggregate supply is the total amount of goods and services that firms are willing and able to sell at a given price level in an economy. It reflects the relationship between the price level and the quantity of output that firms are prepared to produce and sell.

### Key Concepts

- **Price Level**: Aggregate supply is responsive to changes in the overall price level in the economy.
- **Production Costs**: Factors such as wages, raw materials, and taxes can affect production costs and thus influence aggregate supply.
- **Government Policies**: Supply-side policies aimed at improving productive efficiency can shift the aggregate supply curve.

### Examples

1. **Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS)**: In the short run, production costs are somewhat fixed, and the aggregate supply curve is upward sloping, indicating that higher prices lead to an increase in output.
2. **Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS)**: In the long run, input prices adjust, and the aggregate supply curve is vertical at the full employment level of output, indicating that the economy is at its maximum sustainable capacity.

### Applications

- **Economic Policy**: Understanding aggregate supply is crucial for policymakers to design effective economic policies, especially supply-side policies that can enhance the productive capacity of the economy.
- **Business Planning**: Businesses use knowledge of aggregate supply dynamics to make decisions about production, investment, and pricing.

### Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Aggregate Demand]]**: Aggregate supply interacts with aggregate demand to determine the overall level of prices and output in the economy.
- **[[Equilibrium]]**: The intersection of the aggregate supply and aggregate demand curves determines the equilibrium price level and output.
- **[[Economic Growth]]**: Shifts in the long-run aggregate supply curve are associated with economic growth and changes in the economy's potential output.
