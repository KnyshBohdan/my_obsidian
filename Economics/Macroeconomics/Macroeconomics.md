Macroeconomics is a branch of economics that studies the behavior, structure, performance, and decision-making of an economy as a whole. This encompasses regional, national, and global economies, and involves analyzing broad economic factors such as GDP, unemployment rates, price indices, inflation, and international trade.

### Definition

Macroeconomics examines the aggregated indicators of an economy to understand how the whole economy functions. It deals with the economy-wide phenomena such as inflation, price levels, rate of economic growth, national income, gross domestic product (GDP), and changes in unemployment.

### Key Concepts

- **GDP (Gross Domestic Product)**: Measures the total value of all goods and services produced over a specific time period.
- **Unemployment Rate**: The percentage of the labor force that is jobless and actively seeking employment.
- **Inflation**: The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising.
- **Fiscal Policy**: Government policy that attempts to influence the direction of the economy through changes in government spending or taxes.
- **Monetary Policy**: The process by which the monetary authority of a country controls the supply of money, often targeting an inflation rate or interest rate to ensure price stability and general trust in the currency.

### Examples

1. **Fiscal Stimulus**: An increase in government spending or a decrease in taxes to stimulate economic growth.
2. **Monetary Easing**: Lowering interest rates to encourage borrowing and investment.

### Applications

- **Policy Making**: Macroeconomic models help in formulating economic policies and understanding the effects of various policy decisions.
- **Economic Forecasting**: Macroeconomists predict future economic conditions to help governments and businesses make informed decisions.
