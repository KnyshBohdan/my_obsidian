The Cutting Plane Method is a powerful tool in mathematical optimization that iteratively refines the feasible set of solutions or the objective function. It's like a sculptor chipping away at a block of marble to reveal the masterpiece hidden within. In the context of optimization, the "masterpiece" is the optimal solution.

## Definition

In mathematical optimization, the Cutting Plane Method is an optimization technique that refines a feasible set or objective function by means of linear inequalities, known as cuts. These cuts are used to find integer solutions to MILP problems and to solve general, not necessarily differentiable, convex optimization problems.

## Mathematical Formulation

The method works by solving a non-integer linear program, known as the linear relaxation of the given integer program. If the obtained optimum is not an integer, a linear inequality, termed a cut, is found that separates the optimum from the convex hull of the true feasible set. This cut is then added to the relaxed linear program, making the current non-integer solution infeasible. The process is repeated until an optimal integer solution is found.

## Examples

1. **Traveling Salesman Problem**: The method can be used to find the shortest route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the original city.
2. **Convex Optimization**: It's used in general convex minimization where gradient methods are not applicable.

## Properties

- **Iterative Refinement**: The method iteratively refines the feasible set or objective function.
- **Linear Inequalities**: It employs linear inequalities, known as cuts, to refine the feasible set.

## Applications

- **Operations Research**: For solving MILP problems.
- **Data Science**: In optimization problems where the objective function is not differentiable.
- **Computer Science**: In algorithms that require finding optimal solutions in a large search space.
