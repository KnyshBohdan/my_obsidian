Optimization refers to the process of finding the best solution to a problem by maximizing or minimizing a particular objective function subject to constraints. It involves selecting the best element from a set of available alternatives.

### Key Concepts

1. **Objective Function**: The function to be maximized or minimized.
2. **Constraints**: Restrictions or limitations on the variables.
3. **Feasibility**: Solutions that meet all constraints.
4. **Global and Local Optima**: Global optima are the absolute best solutions, while local optima are the best solutions within a specific neighborhood.
5. **Multi-objective Optimization**: Optimization with more than one conflicting objective.
6. **Convex Optimization**: A special case where the objective function is convex, and the constraints form a convex set.

### Examples

1. **Linear Programming**: Optimization of a linear objective function, subject to linear equality and inequality constraints.
2. **Quadratic Programming**: Optimization of a quadratic objective function, subject to linear constraints.
3. **Multi-modal Optimization**: Finding multiple good solutions, both globally and locally good.

### Applications

- **Economics**: Used in resource allocation and production efficiency.
- **Engineering**: Design optimization for performance and cost-effectiveness.
- **Machine Learning**: Hyperparameter tuning and model selection.
- **Operations Research**: Scheduling, routing, and inventory management.

### Methods and Techniques
