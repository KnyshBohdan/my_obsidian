Imagine you're an automotive engineer tasked with designing a new car model. You need to consider multiple objectives like fuel efficiency, safety, and cost. Multi-objective Optimization allows you to navigate through these conflicting goals to find a set of optimal solutions.

## Definition

Multi-objective Optimization, also known as Pareto optimization, is concerned with mathematical optimization problems involving more than one objective function to be optimized simultaneously. In such problems, no single solution exists that optimizes each objective; instead, there is a set of Pareto optimal solutions. A solution is considered Pareto optimal if none of the objective functions can be improved without degrading some of the other objective values.

## Mathematical Formulation

A typical multi-objective optimization problem can be mathematically formulated as:

$$\min_{x \in X} (f_1(x), f_2(x), ..., f_k (x))$$

Here, kâ‰¥2 is the number of objectives, and X is the feasible set of decision vectors.

## Properties

- **Pareto Optimality**: A solution is Pareto optimal if no other solution dominates it.
- **Trade-offs**: The method quantifies the trade-offs in satisfying different objectives.

## Applications

- **Engineering**: For optimizing material properties in composite materials.
- **Economics**: In utility theory for making rational choices.
- **Logistics**: For optimizing routes considering time, distance, and cost.
