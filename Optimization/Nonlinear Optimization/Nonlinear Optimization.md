Imagine you're an engineer designing a complex system like a jet engine. The relationships between variables are not linear, and you need to optimize for multiple factors like fuel efficiency, noise reduction, and safety. Nonlinear Optimization provides the mathematical framework to handle such intricate problems.

## Definition

Nonlinear Optimization, also known as Nonlinear Programming (NLP), is the process of solving an optimization problem where some of the constraints or the objective function are nonlinear. It involves the calculation of extrema (maxima, minima, or stationary points) of an objective function over a set of unknown real variables, subject to a system of equalities and inequalities, collectively termed constraints.

## Mathematical Formulation

A general nonlinear optimization problem can be formulated as:

$$\begin{align} Minimize \ f(x) \\ Subject \ to \ g_i(x) \le 0 \ for \ each \ i \in \{ 1, ..., m\} \\ h_j(x) = 0 \ for \ each \ j \in \{1, ..., p \} \\ x \in X\end{align}$$

Here, f(x) is the objective function, gi​(x) and hj​(x) are constraint functions, and X is the feasible set.

## Methods for Solving

- **Convex Optimization**: If the objective function is concave (maximization) or convex (minimization), and the constraint set is convex.
- **Quadratic Programming**: If the objective function is quadratic and the constraints are linear.
- **Branch and Bound Techniques**: For nonconvex problems, dividing the program into subclasses to be solved with convex or linear approximations.

## Applications

- **Engineering**: For optimizing complex systems like electrical circuits or mechanical designs.
- **Data Science**: In machine learning algorithms like neural networks.
- **Economics**: For optimizing utility functions subject to constraints.
