Imagine you're a machine learning engineer trying to minimize the error of a predictive model. Gradient Descent is your go-to algorithm for efficiently finding the minimum of the cost function.

## Definition

Gradient Descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm used for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function. The algorithm takes steps proportional to the negative of the gradient of the function at the current point.

## Mathematical Formulation

The update rule for Gradient Descent is:

$$x_{n + 1} = x_n - \alpha \nabla f(x_n)$$

Here, αα is the learning rate, ∇f(xn) is the gradient of the function at the current point xnxn​, and xn+1 is the next point.

## Properties and Limitations

- **Local Minima**: The algorithm finds local minima, not necessarily the global minimum.
- **Step Size**: The learning rate αα is crucial. A large αα may overshoot the minimum, while a small αα may take too long to converge.
- **Differentiability**: The function must be differentiable for the algorithm to work.

## Applications

- **Machine Learning**: Used in training models by minimizing the cost function.
- **Data Science**: For feature selection and parameter tuning.
- **Engineering**: In control systems and optimization problems.
