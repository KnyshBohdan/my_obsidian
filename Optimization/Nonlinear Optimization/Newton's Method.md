Suppose you're a data scientist trying to find the minimum of a cost function in a machine learning model. Newton's Method can help you find this minimum efficiently, even when the function is nonlinear.

## Definition

Newton's Method, also known as the Newton-Raphson method, is a root-finding algorithm that produces successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function. It starts with an initial guess x0​ for a root of the function f(x) and iteratively refines this guess.

## Mathematical Formulation

The iterative formula for Newton's Method is:

$x_{n + 1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}$

Here, f(x) is the function whose root you're trying to find, f′(x) is its derivative, and xnxn​ and xn+1​ are the current and next approximations of the root, respectively.

## Properties

- **Quadratic Convergence**: The method has at least quadratic convergence for a zero of multiplicity 1, which means the number of correct digits roughly doubles with each step.
- **Initial Guess**: The method usually converges if the initial guess is close enough to the unknown zero and f′(x0)≠0

## Applications

- **Optimization**: Used in finding local minima or maxima of functions.
- **Engineering**: For solving nonlinear equations in various engineering applications.
- **Finance**: In option pricing and other financial calculations.
