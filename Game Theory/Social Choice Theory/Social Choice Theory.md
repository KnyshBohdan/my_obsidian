Social Choice Theory is a theoretical framework that focuses on the aggregation of individual preferences, opinions, or welfare to reach a collective decision. It is a bridge between economics and political science, blending elements of welfare economics and public choice theory.

## Definition

Social Choice Theory is concerned with how to translate the preferences of individuals into the preferences of a group. It uses a set of axioms to form a social welfare function, which is a function that maps each vector of individual preference relations to a single preference relation representing the preference of the group.

## Key Concepts

- **Social Welfare Function**: A function that maps each vector of individual preference relations to a single preference relation representing the group's preference.
    
- **Arrow's Impossibility Theorem**: A cornerstone of social choice theory, this theorem states that it is impossible to design a social welfare function that satisfies both unanimity and independence of irrelevant alternatives without being dictatorial.
    
- **Gibbardâ€“Satterthwaite Theorem**: States that any non-manipulable social choice function that satisfies the property of unanimity is dictatorial.
    

## Applications

- **Voting Systems**: Used to design and analyze voting mechanisms.
    
- **Law and Governance**: Applied to understand how laws or policies are enacted under a constitution.
    
- **Economic Policy**: Used to aggregate individual utilities or preferences to make economic decisions.
    

## Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Game Theory]]**: Social Choice Theory is often considered a subfield or an application of game theory.
    
- **[[Public Choice Theory]]**: Overlaps with public choice theory, especially in the context of political decision-making.
    
- **[[Welfare Economics]]**: Shares methodologies and aims with welfare economics, focusing on social welfare functions.
    
- **[[Mechanism Design]]**: Understanding social choice mechanisms is crucial for designing systems that aggregate individual preferences effectively.
