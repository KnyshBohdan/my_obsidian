The Folk Theorem is a class of theorems that describe a plethora of Nash equilibrium payoff profiles in repeated games. It provides a comprehensive understanding of how repeated interactions among rational players can lead to a wide range of equilibrium outcomes.

## Definition

The Folk Theorem is concerned with infinitely repeated games and focuses on the payoffs of all Nash equilibria in such games. Specifically, it suggests that if players are patient enough and far-sighted (i.e., if the discount factor δ approaches 1), then virtually any average payoff can be achieved in a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium (SPE). Here, "virtually any" is technically defined as "feasible" and "individually rational."

## Key Concepts

- **Subgame-Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPE)**: A refinement of Nash equilibrium that is used in the context of repeated games.
    
- **Discount Factor (δ)**: Represents how much future payoffs are discounted relative to current payoffs.
    
- **Feasibility and Individual Rationality**: Any Nash equilibrium payoff profile must be feasible (a convex combination of possible payoff profiles of the stage game) and individually rational (at least as large as the minmax payoff of that player).
    

## Applications

- **Economics**: Used to understand market dynamics and collusion in oligopolies.
    
- **Political Science**: Applied to study the repeated interactions among political agents.
