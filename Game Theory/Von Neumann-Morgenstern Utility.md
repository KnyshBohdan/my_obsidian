The Von Neumann-Morgenstern Utility serves as a mathematical representation of an individual's preferences when faced with risky or probabilistic outcomes. It provides a framework for understanding behavior towards risk and allows for the quantification of utility in complex decision-making scenarios.

## Definition

The Von Neumann-Morgenstern (VNM) utility function is defined under certain axioms of rational behavior. For a decision-maker faced with risky outcomes, the VNM utility function u(x) is a real-valued function defined over potential outcomes xx. The decision-maker behaves as if they are maximizing the expected value of this utility function.

$$Expected \ Utility = \sum_{i} p_i u(x_i)$$

where pi is the probability of outcome xiâ€‹.

## Axioms

The VNM utility function is based on four axioms:

1. **Completeness**: For any two outcomes, the individual can specify a preference or is indifferent.
2. **Transitivity**: Preferences are consistent across any three options.
3. **Continuity**: There exists a "tipping point" between being better than and worse than a given middle option.
4. **Independence**: Preferences remain consistent even when irrelevant alternatives are introduced.

## Applications

- **Economics**: Used in market models to understand consumer and firm behavior under uncertainty.
- **Finance**: Applied in portfolio theory to optimize risky asset allocations.
- **Healthcare**: Used in medical decision-making where outcomes are uncertain.

## Examples

1. **Investment Choices**: An investor might use VNM utility to decide between a risky stock and a safe bond.
2. **Insurance**: Individuals may opt for insurance coverage to maximize their expected utility, given the risks involved.

## Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Game Theory]]**: VNM utility is often used in game theory to model players' preferences.
- **[[Decision Theory]]**: It extends basic utility theory to scenarios involving risk.
- **[[Probability Theory]]**: The concept of expected utility integrates probabilities into decision-making.
