Cooperative games, also known as coalitional games, are a type of game where groups of players, referred to as "coalitions," can enforce cooperative behavior through external mechanisms like contracts. This is in contrast to non-cooperative games, where alliances are either not possible or need to be self-enforcing.

## Definition

A cooperative game is defined by a value for every possible coalition of players. Formally, it consists of a finite set of players N, called the grand coalition, and a characteristic function $v:2^Nâ†’R$ that maps the set of all possible coalitions to a set of payments. The function vv describes how much collective payoff a set of players can gain by forming a coalition.

## Key Features

- **Common Interests**: Players share a common goal or outcome, providing the foundation for cooperation.
    
- **Necessary Information Exchange**: Cooperation requires communication and information exchange among players to identify opportunities for mutual gain.
    
- **Voluntariness, Equality, and Mutual Benefit**: Players voluntarily form coalitions and make agreements that must be mutually beneficial to sustain cooperation.
    

## Mathematical Framework

In cooperative game theory, the characteristic function vv describes the value that each coalition can generate. For example, if N={1,2,3}, then v({1,2}) would represent the value that players 1 and 2 can generate by cooperating.

## Applications

- **Contract Law**: Often used to model scenarios where contracts can enforce cooperation.
    
- **Mechanism Design**: Useful in designing systems where players with different information interact.

- **[[Non-Cooperative Games]]**: Cooperative games can be analyzed through the lens of non-cooperative game theory, provided that sufficient assumptions are made.
    
- **[[Game Theory]]**: Cooperative games are a foundational concept within the broader field of game theory.
