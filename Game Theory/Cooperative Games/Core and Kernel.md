## Brief Description

In cooperative game theory, the Core is the set of feasible allocations where no coalition of players can benefit by breaking away from the grand coalition. It represents situations where cooperation among all players can be sustained.

## Definition

The Core of a cooperative game is defined as the set of all feasible allocations xx such that no coalition CC can improve upon it. Formally, an allocation xx is in the Core if:

∑i∈Cxi≥v(C)for all subsets (coalitions) C⊆Ni∈C∑​xi​≥v(C)for all subsets (coalitions) C⊆N

Here, v(C)v(C) is the value that coalition CC can generate.

## Properties

- **Efficiency**: The sum of the payoffs in the Core equals the value of the grand coalition, ∑i∈Nxi=v(N)∑i∈N​xi​=v(N).
    
- **Convexity**: The Core is a set that satisfies a system of weak linear inequalities, making it closed and convex.

# Kernel

## Brief Description

The Kernel is another solution concept in cooperative games that focuses on fairness and stability. It is closely related to the Core and provides additional insights into the distribution of payoffs.

## Definition

The Kernel is not explicitly defined in the sources, but it is generally considered as a refinement or subset of the Core that focuses on fairness among players.

## Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Cooperative Games]]**: The Kernel is often studied in relation to the Core and provides a more nuanced understanding of stable and fair allocations.
