The Shapley Value is a solution concept in cooperative game theory that assigns a unique distribution of a total surplus generated by the coalition of all players. It aims to answer how important each player is to the overall cooperation and what payoff they can reasonably expect.

## Definition

In a cooperative game with a set NN of nn players and a characteristic function $v:2^N→R$, the Shapley Value ϕi(v) for player i is defined as:

$$\phi_i(v) = \sum_{S \subset N \ \{ i\}} \frac{|S|! (n - |S| - 1)!}{n!} (v(S\cup \{ i\}) - v(S))$$

Here, v(S) is the worth of coalition S, and the sum extends over all subsets S of N not containing player i.

## Properties

- **Efficiency**: The sum of the Shapley Values equals the value of the grand coalition, $\sum_{i \in N}\phi_i(v) = v(N)$
    
- **Symmetry**: If two players are symmetric in a game, they receive the same Shapley Value.
    
- **Null Player**: A player who does not contribute to any coalition receives a Shapley Value of zero.
    
- **Additivity**: For any two games vv and ww, the Shapley Value of their sum is the sum of their Shapley Values.
    

## Applications

- **Cost-Sharing**: In games with concave cost functions, the Shapley Value optimizes the price of anarchy and stability.
    
- **Political Science**: Known as the Shapley–Shubik power index, it measures the power distribution in committees.
