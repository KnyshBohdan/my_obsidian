Arrow's Impossibility Theorem, named after economist and Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow, posits that no ranked voting system can perfectly aggregate individual preferences into a collective ranking while satisfying a set of fairness criteria. The theorem has far-reaching implications for democratic systems, economics, and decision-making processes.

## Definition

The theorem states that when voters have three or more distinct alternatives, no ranked voting system can convert the ranked preferences of individuals into a community-wide (complete and transitive) ranking while also meeting the following criteria:

1. **Unrestricted Domain**: The system must be able to handle any set of individual preferences.
2. **Non-Dictatorship**: No single voter should have the power to unilaterally determine the group's preference.
3. **Pareto Efficiency**: If every voter prefers alternative X over Y, then the group should also prefer X over Y.
4. **Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives**: The group's preference between X and Y should depend only on individual preferences between X and Y.

Mathematically, the theorem asserts that no social welfare function exists that satisfies all these conditions if the decision-making body has at least two members and at least three options to decide among.

## Implications and Controversies

The theorem challenges the idea of a "common will" of the people and suggests that the aggregation of individual preferences into a collective decision is inherently flawed. Some scholars argue that the theorem shows democracy, as government by the will of the people, is an incoherent illusion. Others contend that some conditions of the theorem are unreasonable and that prospects for collective choice are brighter than the theorem suggests.

## Applications

- **Voting Theory**: The theorem is often cited in discussions about the design of electoral systems.
- **Economics**: It has implications for welfare economics and market design.
- **Decision Theory**: The theorem is relevant in multi-criteria decision-making processes.
