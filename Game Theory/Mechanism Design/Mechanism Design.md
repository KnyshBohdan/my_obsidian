Mechanism Design is the science of rule-making in game theory. It aims to design systems with strategic participants to achieve desired outcomes, such as Pareto efficiency, fairness, or revenue maximization.

## Definition

Mechanism Design involves creating a set of rules or mechanisms that guide the actions of players in a game. These mechanisms specify the actions available to each player and how these actions map to outcomes. The design process takes into account the private information and strategic behavior of the players.

## Key Concepts

- **Bayesian Game Setting**: This is the background setting that includes agents, their types, and utility functions. The mechanism designer does not control this but uses it as a foundation for designing the game.
    
- **Actions and Outcomes**: Mechanisms specify the set of actions for each player and how these actions map to outcomes. For example, in an auction, the actions could be bids, and the outcome could be the allocation of goods.
    
- **Social Choice Function**: This function maps the types of all agents to a set of possible outcomes. It is often the objective to implement this function through the mechanism.
    

## Examples

- **Voting Systems**: Mechanism design can be used to create voting rules that are fair and resistant to strategic manipulation.
    
- **Auctions**: Different types of auctions like first-price, second-price, and Vickrey auctions are examples of mechanisms designed to allocate goods efficiently.
    

## Applications

- **Online Advertising**: Mechanism design is crucial in sponsored search auctions for selling online advertising.
    
- **Contract Theory**: It is used in designing contracts that align the incentives of parties involved.
    

## Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Game Theory]]**: Mechanism Design is a specialized area within game theory focused on designing games rather than analyzing them.
    
- **[[Cooperative Games]]**: Mechanism design often intersects with cooperative game concepts like the Core and Shapley Value to ensure stable and fair outcomes.
    
- **[[Auction Theory]]**: Mechanism design is fundamental in auction theory, dictating how auctions should be structured for optimal results.
    
- **[[Behavioral Game Theory]]**: Understanding human behavior and bounded rationality can inform the design of more effective mechanisms.
