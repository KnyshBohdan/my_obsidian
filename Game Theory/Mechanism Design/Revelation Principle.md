The Revelation Principle is a fundamental principle in mechanism design that states if a social choice function can be implemented by an arbitrary mechanism, then the same function can also be implemented by a direct, incentive-compatible mechanism. Essentially, it narrows down the search for mechanisms by focusing only on those where agents truthfully reveal their private information.

## Definition

The Revelation Principle asserts that if a social choice function can be implemented by an arbitrary mechanism with an equilibrium outcome, then the same function can be implemented by an incentive-compatible direct mechanism with the same equilibrium outcome. Formally, if a mechanism MM has an equilibrium outcome that corresponds to a social choice function ff, then there exists a direct mechanism DD that also implements ff and is incentive-compatible.

## Key Concepts

- **Incentive Compatibility**: The principle comes in two variants corresponding to the two flavors of incentive-compatibility:
    
    - **Dominant-Strategy Revelation Principle**: Every social-choice function that can be implemented in dominant strategies can be implemented by a dominant-strategy-incentive-compatible (DSIC) mechanism.
    - **Bayesian-Nash Revelation Principle**: Every social-choice function that can be implemented in Bayesian-Nash equilibrium can be implemented by a Bayesian-Nash incentive-compatible (BNIC) mechanism.
- **Simplification of the Design Problem**: By narrowing the area needed to be searched, the problem of finding a mechanism becomes much easier.
    

## Applications

- **Auctions**: The Revelation Principle is often used to simplify the design of auctions.
    
- **Resource Allocation**: It is also used in various resource allocation problems to find mechanisms that are both efficient and incentive-compatible.
