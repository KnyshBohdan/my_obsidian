Level-k Thinking is a concept in behavioral and experimental game theory that captures the notion of bounded rationality in strategic interactions. It is an extension of the idea of iterated reasoning about other players' actions and beliefs. The concept has been applied to both normal-form and extensive-form games, and it allows for the updating of beliefs about opponents' levels of reasoning during the play of the game.

#### Definition

In Level-k Thinking, players are categorized into different "levels" based on their depth of strategic reasoning. A level-0 player is assumed to choose actions randomly, without strategic consideration. A level-1 player best responds to a level-0 player, a level-2 player best responds to a level-1 player, and so on. Formally, for a given first-level belief profile β1​:

- $L_i^1(β_1)$ is the set of actions that are rational for player i given the belief βi1​.
- $L_i^k(β_1)$ is the set of actions that are rational for player i given the belief that others are (k−1)-level players.

#### Additional Information

- **Extensive-Form Level-k Thinking**: This is an extension of Level-k Thinking to extensive-form games. It allows for the updating of beliefs about opponents' levels of reasoning as the game progresses.
    
- **Comparison with Other Concepts**: Level-k Thinking is often compared with other solution concepts like rationalizability, iterated admissibility, and backward induction. It refines some of these concepts under certain conditions.
    

#### Examples

1. **Beauty Contest Game**: Players try to pick a number as close as possible to some fraction of the average number chosen by all players. Level-1 players might choose the average, while Level-2 players choose a number close to the average of Level-1 choices.
    
2. **Auction Theory**: Level-k Thinking has been applied to understand bidding strategies in auctions.
    

#### Applications

- **Experimental Game Theory**: Used to explain data from various experimental games.
- **Mechanism Design**: Helps in designing systems where players with different information interact.
- **Financial Markets**: Applied to understand market microstructures.
