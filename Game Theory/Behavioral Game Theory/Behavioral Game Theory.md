Behavioral Game Theory aims to examine how people's strategic decision-making is influenced by social preferences, psychological factors, and other non-standard considerations. Unlike traditional game theory, which assumes rationality and utility maximization, behavioral game theory focuses on how actual human behavior deviates from these assumptions.

## Definition

Behavioral Game Theory integrates methods from game theory, experimental economics, and experimental psychology to analyze interactive strategic decisions and behavior. It challenges the traditional game theory assumptions of rationality, selfishness, and utility maximization by introducing psychological principles like altruism, fairness, and framing effects.

## Key Concepts

- **Allais Paradox and Ellsberg Paradox**: Early works that showed choices made by participants do not always reflect the utility-maximizing choice.
- **Regret Theory, Prospect Theory, and Hyperbolic Discounting**: These theories show that decision-makers consider many factors, such as minimizing regret and social preferences.
- **Ultimatum and Bargaining Games**: These games examine the effect of emotions and trust on decision-making outcomes.

## Applications

- **Economic Markets**: Understanding consumer behavior and market dynamics.
- **Social Dilemmas**: Investigating cooperation and competition in social settings.
- **Policy Design**: Informing the design of policies that account for human behavior.

## Methodologies

Behavioral Game Theory employs both empirical and theoretical research, including laboratory and field experiments. Recently, machine learning methods have been applied to improve both prediction and understanding of behavior in games.
