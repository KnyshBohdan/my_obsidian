Quantal Response Equilibrium is a concept that extends the traditional Nash equilibrium by incorporating bounded rationality. Unlike Nash equilibrium, QRE allows for errors in players' choices and provides a probabilistic framework for understanding strategy selection.

## Definition

In a QRE, players are assumed to make errors when choosing which pure strategy to play. The probability of any particular strategy being chosen is positively related to the payoff from that strategy. In other words, very costly errors are unlikely. The equilibrium arises from the realization of beliefs, where a player's payoffs are computed based on beliefs about other players' probability distribution over strategies. In equilibrium, a player's beliefs are correct.

## Mathematical Formulation

In a logit equilibrium, a specific form of QRE, the probability Pij​ of player ii choosing strategy j is given by:

$$P_{i, j} = \frac{exp(\lambda E U_{i, j}(P_{-i}))}{\sum_{k} exp(\lambda E U_{ik}(P_{-i}))}$$

Here, λ is the rationality parameter. As λ→0, players become completely non-rational, and as λ→∞, play approaches a Nash equilibrium.

## Applications

- **Experimental Data**: QRE is particularly useful when analyzing data from actual games, especially from laboratory experiments.
    
- **High-Stakes Environments**: QRE has been found to explain behavior in high-stakes environments like the American television game show "The Price Is Right."
    

## Critiques

- **Non-Falsifiability**: QRE is not falsifiable in any normal-form game, even with significant a priori restrictions on payoff perturbations.
