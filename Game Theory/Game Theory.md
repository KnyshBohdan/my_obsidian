Definition

Game Theory is a mathematical framework for analyzing strategic interactions among rational agents. In its most basic form, it involves players, strategies, and payoffs. The players can be individuals, corporations, or even nations. Each player has a set of strategies and receives a payoff depending on the strategies chosen by all players. The objective is to find the "equilibrium" where no player has an incentive to deviate from their current strategy, given the strategies of the other players.

Equilibrium: $\forall i, u_i (s_i^*, s^*_{- j}) \ge u_i (s_i, s^{*}_{-i})$

where ui​ is the utility for player i, si∗ is the equilibrium strategy for player ii, and s−i∗ are the equilibrium strategies of all other players.

## Classification

Games can be classified based on:

- **Number of Players**: One-person, two-person, or n-person games.
- **Information Availability**: Perfect or imperfect information.
- **Sum of Payoffs**: Constant-sum or variable-sum games.
- **Cooperation**: Cooperative or non-cooperative games.

## Examples

1. **Prisoner's Dilemma**: A classic example of a non-cooperative game where two prisoners must decide whether to betray each other or remain silent.
    
2. **Chess**: A two-player game of perfect information.
    

## Properties

- **Finite and Infinite Games**: A game is finite if it has a finite number of players, strategies, and cannot go on indefinitely.
    
- **Normal and Extensive Form**: Games can be represented in a payoff matrix (normal form) or a game tree (extensive form).
    

## Applications

- **Economics**: In market competition and auction designs.
- **Political Science**: In voting systems and international relations.
- **Computer Science**: In algorithmic game theory and multi-agent systems.
