Rationalizability is a concept in game theory that aims to provide the weakest constraints on players while still requiring that they are rational. It is more permissive than Nash equilibrium and focuses on the rationalizable set of actions that players can take based on their beliefs about their opponents' actions.

## Definition

In a normal-form game, the rationalizable set of actions for each player can be computed through an iterative process:

1. Start with the full action set for each player.
2. Remove all actions that are never a best reply to any belief about the opponents' actions.
3. Continue this process until no further actions are eliminated.

The remaining set of actions are the rationalizable actions for each player.

## Key Concepts

- **Constraints on Beliefs**: Rationalizability allows for an infinite chain of consistent beliefs that result in players choosing rationalizable actions.
    
- **Comparison with Nash Equilibrium**: A Nash equilibrium is a subset of rationalizable equilibria, making rationalizability a generalization of the Nash equilibrium concept.
    

## Examples

- **Coordination Game**: In a simple coordination game, the row player can play "a" if he believes the column player will play "A", and vice versa.
    
- **Prisoner's Dilemma**: In this game, not all strategies are rationalizable. For example, a strategy that is not a best response to any strategy by the opponent is not rationalizable.
    

## Applications

- **Epistemic Foundations**: Rationalizability is often used in the study of higher-order beliefs in game theory.
    
- **Mechanism Design**: It is used in designing systems where players with different information interact.

- **[[Level-k Thinking]]**: Rationalizability can be seen as a refinement of the concept of Level-k Thinking.
