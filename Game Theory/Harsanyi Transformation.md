The Harsanyi Transformation is a method used to transform games with incomplete information into games with complete but imperfect information. It was introduced by John C. Harsanyi and serves as a way to model uncertainty over players' strategy sets and payoffs.

## Definition

In a game with incomplete information, players may not know certain elements about the game or other players. The Harsanyi Transformation introduces a "Nature" player who randomly assigns types to real players according to certain probability distributions. This transforms the game into one with complete but imperfect information, where the uncertainty is now modeled as part of the game itself.

Nature assigns types to players: Ti→P(Ti)

where Ti is the type set for player ii and P(Ti) is the probability distribution over Ti​.

## Assumptions and Implications

The transformation assumes that players are rational and that there is a common belief of rationality. However, it has been shown that the implications of the transformation are not necessarily maintained without a common belief of rationality.

## Applications

- **Game Theory**: Used to analyze games with incomplete information.
- **Economics**: Applied in market models where agents have incomplete information.
- **Decision Making**: Useful in scenarios where decision-making involves uncertainty.

## Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Game Theory]]**: The Harsanyi Transformation is a specialized concept within game theory for dealing with incomplete information.
- **[[Decision Theory]]**: It extends the framework of decision theory to include strategic interactions under uncertainty.
- **[[Probability Theory]]**: The concept of probability distributions is central to the transformation.
