Repeated Games are an extension of game theory where a base game, known as a stage game, is played multiple times. This framework captures the idea that players must consider the impact of their current actions on future interactions, often referred to as their reputation.

## Definition

In game theory, a Repeated Game is an extensive-form game that consists of multiple repetitions of a base game, known as a stage game. The stage game is usually one of the well-studied 2-person games. The repeated game framework allows players to take into account the impact of their current actions on future actions, sometimes referred to as their reputation.

## Key Concepts

- **Finite vs. Infinite Repeated Games**: Repeated games can be finite, where players know the game will end after a specific number of rounds, or infinite, where the game continues indefinitely or the end is unknown.
    
- **Backward Induction**: In finite games, backward induction can be used to solve the game, starting from the last round and working backward.
    
- **Trigger Strategies**: In infinitely repeated games, trigger strategies can be used to enforce cooperation. If a player deviates from a cooperative strategy, the other player can "trigger" a punishment, reducing payoffs for both.
    
- **Folk Theorems**: These are results that deal with how to achieve and maintain socially optimal equilibria in repeated games.
    

## Applications

- **Economics**: Used to model oligopoly, cartels, and various market structures.
    
- **Political Science**: Applied to voting systems, power dynamics, and international relations.
    

## Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Game Theory]]**: Repeated Games are a specialized form within game theory.
    
- **[[Nash Equilibrium]]**: The concept of Nash Equilibrium is central to the analysis of repeated games.
    
- **[[Subgame Perfect Equilibrium]]**: This concept is particularly relevant for extensive-form repeated games.
    
- **[[Non-cooperative Games]]**: Repeated games are often modeled as non-cooperative games, focusing on individual strategies over multiple periods.
