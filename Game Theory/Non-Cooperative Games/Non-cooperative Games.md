Non-cooperative games are a form of game under the topic of game theory. These games are used to model situations where there is competition between the players. Unlike cooperative games, there are no external rules that enforce the cooperation of the players, making it a suitable model for competitive environments.

## Definition

A non-cooperative game is characterized by the following elements:

- **Number of Players**: Specifies how many players are involved in the game.
    
- **Actions**: The possible actions available to each player, along with any constraints that may be imposed on them.
    
- **Objective Function**: Each player has an objective function that they attempt to optimize.
    
- **Information Structure**: Specifies any information acquisition that takes place and how the information available to a player at each point in time depends on the past actions of other players.
    

## Key Concepts

- **Zero-Sum and Non Zero-Sum Games**: Both types of games can be modeled as non-cooperative games.
    
- **Nash Equilibrium**: Non-cooperative games are often analyzed to find the Nash equilibria, which are the stable states of the game where no player has an incentive to deviate.
    
- **Rationality**: Assumes that each player is rational and aims to maximize their utility or payoff.
    

## Applications

- **Economics**: Used to model oligopoly, cartels, and various market structures.
    
- **Political Science**: Applied to voting systems, power dynamics, and international relations.
    

## Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Game Theory]]**: Non-cooperative games are a foundational concept within game theory.
    
- **[[Nash Equilibrium]]**: The concept of Nash Equilibrium is central to the analysis of non-cooperative games.
    
- **[[Mechanism Design]]**: Understanding non-cooperative games is crucial for designing mechanisms that induce desired outcomes.
    
- **[[Cooperative Games]]**: Non-cooperative games can also be used to model cooperation, showing the versatility of the concept.
