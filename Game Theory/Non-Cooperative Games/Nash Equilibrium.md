Nash Equilibrium is a state in a non-cooperative game where no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy. It serves as a solution concept that defines the optimal strategies for all players involved, given the strategies chosen by the other players.

## Definition

A Nash Equilibrium is a set of mixed strategies for finite, non-cooperative games between two or more players whereby no player can improve his or her payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy. Formally, a strategy profile (s1∗,s2∗,…,sn∗) is a Nash Equilibrium if for each player ii, si∗​ is a best response to s−i∗​, where s−i∗ denotes the strategies of all players except i.

## Key Concepts

- **Optimal Outcome**: In a Nash Equilibrium, each player's strategy is optimal when considering the decisions of other players.
- **Multiple Equilibria**: A game may have multiple Nash Equilibria or none at all.
- **Rational Agents**: The concept assumes that players are rational and will choose strategies that maximize their own payoffs.

## Applications

- **Economics**: Used to model competition, bargaining, and price formation.
    
- **Political Science**: Applied in voting systems and power dynamics.
    
- **Biology**: Used to model evolutionary strategies.
