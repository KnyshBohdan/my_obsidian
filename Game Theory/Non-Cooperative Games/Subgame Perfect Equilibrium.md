Subgame Perfect Equilibrium is a solution concept in game theory that refines the idea of Nash Equilibrium for dynamic games. It ensures that players' strategies form a Nash Equilibrium in every subgame, not just the game as a whole. This makes it a robust solution concept for multi-stage games where the game can start at any of a number of different points.

## Definition

In game theory, a strategy profile is a Subgame Perfect Equilibrium if it represents a Nash Equilibrium of every subgame of the original game. Formally, a strategy profile (s1∗​,s2∗​,…,sn∗​) is a Subgame Perfect Equilibrium if, for every subgame, the strategies si∗​ are a best response to s−i∗​, where s−i∗ denotes the strategies of all players except ii.

## Key Concepts

- **Backward Induction**: A common method for determining Subgame Perfect Equilibria in finite games is backward induction. This involves starting from the last actions of the game and working backward to determine the optimal strategies for each player.
    
- **Perfect Recall**: The concept assumes that each player remembers all past moves and all of their choices at those moves.
    
- **One-Shot Deviation Principle**: A Subgame Perfect Equilibrium necessarily satisfies this principle, which means that a player will not benefit from deviating from their strategy for one period and then reverting back.
    

## Applications

- **Ultimatum Game**: Provides an intuitive example of a game with fewer Subgame Perfect Equilibria than Nash Equilibria.
    
- **Bargaining Models**: Often used in models of bargaining where the game can start at different stages.
