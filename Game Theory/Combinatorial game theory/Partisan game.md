In the realm of combinatorial game theory, a partisan game is a type of game where the available moves are not the same for both players. This is in contrast to impartial games, where each player has the same set of moves. Partisan games are more complex to analyze and include many traditional games like chess.

#### Definition

A game is considered partisan if some moves are available to one player and not to the other. In other words, the game is not impartial. For example, in chess, only one player can move the white pieces. When analyzed using combinatorial game theory, many chess positions have values that cannot be expressed as the value of an impartial game.

#### Examples

- **Chess**: Only one player can move the white pieces, making it a partisan game.
- **Checkers**: Each player has their own set of pieces to move, again making it partisan.

#### Properties

- **Complexity**: Partisan games are more difficult to analyze than impartial games because the Spragueâ€“Grundy theorem does not apply.
- **Numbers as Games**: The application of combinatorial game theory to partisan games allows the significance of numbers as games to be seen, which is not possible with impartial games.

#### Applications

- **Game Analysis**: Understanding the complexity and strategies of traditional games like chess.
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Used in academic research to develop new methods for game analysis.
