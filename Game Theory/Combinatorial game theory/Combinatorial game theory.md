Combinatorial Game Theory is a specialized branch of game theory that focuses on two-player sequential games with perfect information. Unlike traditional game theory, which may include elements of chance and imperfect information, combinatorial game theory strictly deals with deterministic games where the entire state of the game is known to both players.

#### Definition

Combinatorial Game Theory studies sequential games where two players, often referred to as "Left" and "Right," take turns making moves to change the game's position in defined ways. The objective is to achieve a defined winning condition. The games are represented as a game tree, and each position in the game can be considered a sub-game, leading to a recursive mathematical definition of games.

#### Examples

- **Chess**: A non-trivial game with complex combinatorial structures.
- **Tic-Tac-Toe**: A trivial game considered "easy to solve."
- **Go**: Another non-trivial game with rich combinatorial structures.
- **Nim**: An impartial game foundational to the theory.

#### Applications

- **Artificial Intelligence**: Used in automated planning and scheduling.
- **Mathematics**: Provides new methods for analyzing game trees, such as using surreal numbers.

#### Properties

- **Solved Games**: Some games like Tic-Tac-Toe are considered solved as optimal play from both sides leads to a draw.
- **Game Complexity**: Measures of game complexity and proofs of optimal solution existence are also studied.
