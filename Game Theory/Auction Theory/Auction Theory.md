Auction Theory is an applied branch of economics that focuses on how bidders behave in auction markets. It also examines how the features of auction markets incentivize predictable outcomes. The theory serves as a tool for designing real-world auctions, aiming to raise higher revenues for sellers while allowing buyers to procure at a lower cost.

## Definition

Auction Theory considers auctions as economic games that differ in two main aspects: format and information. The format defines the rules for announcing prices, placing bids, updating prices, and selecting winners. Information asymmetry exists when bidders have private information that they choose to withhold from competitors. For example, bidders usually know their personal valuation of the item, which is unknown to other bidders and the seller.

## Types of Auctions

1. **First-Price Sealed-Bid Auction**: Bidders place their bids in sealed envelopes. The highest bidder wins and pays the amount bid.
2. **Second-Price Sealed-Bid Auctions (Vickrey Auctions)**: The highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest bid.

## Key Concepts

- **Revenue Equivalence**: Different auction formats can yield the same expected revenue under certain conditions.
- **Winner's Curse**: The phenomenon where the winning bidder may overpay for an item.
- **Price of Anarchy**: Measures the efficiency loss due to strategic behavior of bidders.

## Applications

- **Digital Goods**: Auctions for digital assets like domain names.
- **Spectrum Allocation**: Used in allocating radio spectrum licenses.
- **Art and Antiques**: Auctions for high-value items like artworks.
