## Definition

A **σ-Algebra** (also known as a σ-field) on a set X is a nonempty collection Σ of subsets of X that is closed under complement, countable unions, and countable intersections. The ordered pair (X,Σ) is called a **measurable space**.

## Properties

- **Closed Under Complementation**: If A is in Σ, then its complement X∖A is also in Σ.
- **Closed Under Countable Unions**: If A1,A2,A3,… are in Σ, then A=A1​∪A2​∪A3​∪… is also in Σ.

## Motivation and Applications

- **Defining Measures**: σ-Algebras are crucial in the definition of measures, particularly in Lebesgue integration.
- **Probability Theory**: In probability, σ-Algebras are pivotal in the definition of conditional expectation and sufficient statistics.
- **Managing Partial Information**: In scenarios involving partial information, sub-σ-Algebras are used to characterize the relevant subsets.

## Examples

1. **Finite Algebra**: A finite algebra is always a σ-Algebra.
2. **Borel Hierarchy**: The set of subsets of the real line formed by starting with all open intervals and adding in all countable unions, countable intersections, and relative complements.
