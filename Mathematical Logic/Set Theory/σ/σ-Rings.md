Кiльце множин називається σ-кiльцем, якщо разом iз кожною послiдовнiстю множин A1, A2, . . . , An, . . . воно мiстить їх об’єднання $S = \bigcup_n A_n$

## Definition

In mathematics, a **σ-Ring** is a nonempty collection of sets that is closed under countable union and relative complementation. Formally, a collection RR is a σ-ring if it satisfies the following conditions:

1. **Closed under Countable Unions**: ⋃n=1∞An∈R⋃n=1∞​An​∈R if An∈RAn​∈R for all n∈Nn∈N.
2. **Closed under Relative Complementation**: A∖B∈RA∖B∈R if A,B∈RA,B∈R.

## Properties

- **Closure under Countable Intersections**: These two properties imply that ⋂n=1∞An∈R⋂n=1∞​An​∈R whenever A1,A2,…A1​,A2​,… are elements of RR.

## Uses

- σ-Rings can be used as an alternative to σ-fields (σ-algebras) in the development of measure and integration theory, especially when one does not wish to require that the universal set be measurable.
- Every σ-field is also a σ-ring, but a σ-ring need not be a σ-field.
