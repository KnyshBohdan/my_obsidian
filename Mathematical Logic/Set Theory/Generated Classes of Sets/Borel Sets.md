Важливу роль в аналiзi вiдiграють борелiвськi множини. Борелiвськi множини – це множини на числовiй прямiй, що належать мiнiмальнiй σ-алгебрi, що породжена сукупнiстю всiх вiдрiзкiв $[a, b]$(або iнтервалiв (a, b), або напiвiнтервалiв (a, b], $[a, b)$)
## Definition

In mathematics, a **Borel set** is a set in a topological space that can be formed from open sets (or equivalently, from closed sets) through the operations of countable union, countable intersection, and relative complement. Formally, the collection of all Borel sets on a topological space XX forms a σσ-algebra, known as the **Borel algebra** or **Borel σσ-algebra**. This Borel algebra is the smallest σσ-algebra containing all open sets (or equivalently, all closed sets).

## Properties

- **Measure Theory**: Borel sets are crucial in measure theory. Any measure defined on the open sets or closed sets must also be defined on all Borel sets. Measures defined on Borel sets are called Borel measures.
    
- **Descriptive Set Theory**: Borel sets and the associated Borel hierarchy play a fundamental role in descriptive set theory.
    

## Examples

1. **Real Numbers**: The Borel algebra on the set of real numbers is the smallest σσ-algebra that contains all the intervals.
    
2. **Metric Spaces**: In metric spaces, Borel sets can be generated from the class of open sets by iterating certain operations to the first uncountable ordinal.
    

## Applications

- **Probability Theory**: The Borel algebra on the real numbers is the algebra on which the Lebesgue measure is defined, which is essential in probability theory.
