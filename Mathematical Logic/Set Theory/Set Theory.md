Set Theory is the branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which can be informally described as collections of objects. It serves as a foundational system for the whole of mathematics and provides a framework for a mathematical theory of infinity.

## Definition

A set is a collection of definite, distinguishable objects of perception or thought, conceived as a whole. These objects are called elements or members of the set. Set Theory is concerned with the properties of these sets, their relationships, and their hierarchical structure.

## Key Concepts

- **Axiomatic Systems**: Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC) is the most commonly used set of axioms for set theory.
    
- **Cardinality**: The measure of the "size" of a set, which can be finite or infinite.
    
- **Naive vs. Axiomatic Set Theory**: Naive set theory is the non-formalized initial stage of set theory, which led to paradoxes like Russell's paradox. Axiomatic set theory aims to resolve these issues.
    

## Applications

- **Mathematics**: Foundation for almost all branches of mathematics.
    
- **Computer Science**: In the theory of relational algebra and databases.
    
- **Philosophy and Formal Semantics**: For understanding the nature of mathematical objects and the structure of language.
