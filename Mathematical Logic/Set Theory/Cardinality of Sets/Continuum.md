In set theory, the term "continuum" refers to the real numbers or their corresponding infinite cardinal number, denoted by cc. Georg Cantor proved that the cardinality of the continuum is larger than the smallest infinity, namely $N_0$​. He also demonstrated that cc is equal to $2^{N_0}$, the cardinality of the power set of the natural numbers.

## Continuum Hypothesis

The Continuum Hypothesis posits that no cardinality lies between that of the continuum and $N_0$​, or alternatively, that $c =N_1$​.

## Linear Continuum

According to Raymond Wilder, a set C and a relation < form a linear continuum if:

1. C is simply ordered with respect to <.
2. If $[A,B]$ is a cut of C, then either A has a last element or B has a first element. (Compare with [[Dedekind cut]])
3. There exists a non-empty, countable subset S of C such that if x,y∈S and x<y, then there exists z. (Separability axiom)
4. C has no first element and no last element. (Unboundedness axiom)

These axioms characterize the order type of the real number line.
