In mathematics, the cardinality of a set is a measure of the "size" or the number of elements in the set. For finite sets, the cardinality is simply the count of elements. For infinite sets, the concept is generalized to distinguish between different types of infinity. The cardinality of a set A is usually denoted by ∣A∣.

## Types of Cardinality

- **Finite Cardinality**: A set A has finite cardinality if ∣A∣ is a natural number.
    
- **Countable Infinity**: A set A is said to be countably infinite if ∣A∣ has the same cardinality as the set of natural numbers $N_{0}$.
    
- **Uncountable Infinity**: A set A is said to be uncountably infinite if ∣A∣ has a cardinality greater than that of the natural numbers.
    

## Properties

- **Bijective Functions**: Two sets A and B have the same cardinality if there exists a bijective function between them.
    
- **Injective Functions**: A set A has cardinality less than or equal to B if there exists an injective function from A to B.
    
- **Schröder–Bernstein Theorem**: If ∣A∣≤∣B∣ and ∣B∣≤∣A∣, then ∣A∣=∣B∣.
    

## Historical Context

The concept of cardinality was generalized in the late 19th century to include infinite sets. Georg Cantor was instrumental in formulating the notion of cardinality, especially for infinite sets.
