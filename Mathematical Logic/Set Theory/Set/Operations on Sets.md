### Union

The union of two sets A and B is a set that contains all the elements that are in A, or in B, or in both. It is denoted by A∪B.

### Intersection

The intersection of two sets A and B is a set that contains all the elements that are in both A and B. It is denoted by A∩B.

### Difference

The difference of two sets A and B is a set that contains all the elements that are in A but not in B. It is denoted by A−B or A∖B.

### Complement

Given a universal set U, the complement of a set A is the set of all elements in U that are not in A. It is denoted by A′ or $A^c$.

## Advanced Operations

### Cartesian Product

The Cartesian product of two sets A and B is a set of all ordered pairs (a,b) where a∈A and b∈B. It is denoted by A×B.

### Power Set

The power set of a set A is the set of all subsets of A. It is denoted by P(A).

## Properties

- **Commutative**: A∪B=B∪A and A∩B=B∩A
    
- **Associative**: (A∪B)∪C=A∪(B∪C) and (A∩B)∩C=A∩(B∩C)
    
- **Distributive**: A∩(B∪C)=(A∩B)∪(A∩C) and A∪(B∩C)=(A∪B)∩(A∪C)
