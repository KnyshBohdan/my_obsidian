Two sets S and T are said to be equivalent if and only if there exists a bijection f:S→T between the elements of S and those of T. In other words, they have the same cardinality. This equivalence is denoted as S∼T.

## Notations

- **Also denoted as**: S≃T or S≈T
    
- **Other terms**: Equipotent, Equipollent, Equinumerous, Similar
    

## Properties

- **Cardinality**: Equivalent sets have the same cardinality, meaning they have the same "size" or "power."
    
- **Bijection**: The existence of a bijection between two sets is a necessary and sufficient condition for them to be equivalent.
    

## Historical Note

The notion of set equivalence was first introduced by Georg Cantor in 1878. The term he used was "Mächtigkeit."
