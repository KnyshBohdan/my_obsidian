In mathematics, a set is a collection of distinct objects, referred to as elements or members. Sets can contain various types of mathematical objects like numbers, symbols, points in space, lines, and even other sets.

## Definition

A set is a mathematical model for a collection of different things. A set contains elements or members, which can be mathematical objects of any kind: numbers, symbols, points in space, lines, other geometrical shapes, variables, or even other sets. Two sets are considered equal if they contain precisely the same elements.

## Key Concepts

- **Roster Notation**: Sets can be defined by listing their elements between curly brackets, separated by commas. For example, {4,2,1,3}} or {blue, white, red}.
    
- **Semantic Definition**: Sets can also be defined using a rule to determine what the elements are. For example, let A be the set whose members are the first four positive integers.
    
- **Set-builder Notation**: Specifies a set as a selection from a larger set, determined by a condition on the elements. For example, F={n∣n is an integer, and 0≤n≤19}.
    
- **Membership**: If xx is an element of set A, this is written as x∈A.
    
- **Empty Set**: The set with no elements, denoted as ∅.
    
- **Singleton Set**: A set with exactly one element.
    
- **Subsets**: If every element of set A is also in set B, then A is a subset of B, written A⊆B.
    

## Applications

- Sets are foundational to modern mathematics.
    
- Used in the theory of relational algebra and databases.
    
- Important in the study of functions and relations.
    

## Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Set Theory]]**: The broader field that studies sets in a rigorous manner.
    
- **[[Functions]]**: Sets are crucial in defining functions between different mathematical objects.
    
- **[[Cardinality]]**: The concept of size or cardinality of a set is a key aspect in set theory.
    
- **[[Algebra of Sets]]**: Basic operations like union, intersection, and complement are defined in terms of sets.
- [[Mathematical Logic]]
