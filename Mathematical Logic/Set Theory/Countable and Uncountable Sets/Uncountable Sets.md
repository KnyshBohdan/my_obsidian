## Definition

In mathematics, an **uncountable set** is an infinite set that contains too many elements to be countable. Formally, a set X is uncountable if its cardinal number is larger than that of the set of all natural numbers ($N_0$​).

## Characterizations

A set X is uncountable if and only if any of the following conditions hold:

1. There is no injective function (hence no bijection) from X to the set of natural numbers.
2. X is nonempty and for every ω-sequence of elements of X, there exists at least one element of X not included in it.
3. The cardinality of X is neither finite nor equal to $N_0$

## Properties

- If an uncountable set X is a subset of set Y, then Y is also uncountable.

## Examples

1. **Real Numbers**: The set R of all real numbers is uncountable. Cantor's diagonal argument shows that this set is uncountable.
2. **Cantor Set**: This is an uncountable subset of R and is a fractal with Hausdorff dimension greater than zero but less than one.
3. **Functions**: The set of all functions from R to R is even "more uncountable" than RR in the sense that its cardinality is larger.
