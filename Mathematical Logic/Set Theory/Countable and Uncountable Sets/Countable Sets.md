In mathematics, a set is considered **countable** if it is either finite or can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers. Formally, a set S is countable if:

1. Its cardinality ∣S∣ is less than or equal to $N_0$​, the cardinality of the set of natural numbers N.
2. There exists an injective function from S to N.

A set that is not finite but is countable is said to be **countably infinite**.

## Properties

- **Cardinality**: The cardinality of a countable set is either finite or ℵ0ℵ0​.
- **Bijection**: There exists a bijective mapping between a countable set and a subset of the natural numbers.
- **Subsets**: A subset of a countable set is also countable.

## Examples

1. **Natural Numbers**: N={0,1,2,3,…} is countably infinite.
2. **Even Integers**: {0,2,4,6,…} is countably infinite.
3. **Rational Numbers**: Q is countable.

## History

The concept is attributed to Georg Cantor, who also proved the existence of uncountable sets, such as the set of real numbers.
