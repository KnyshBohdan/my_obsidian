In mathematics, a **Field of Sets** is a structure (X,F) consisting of a set X and a family F of subsets, referred to as an algebra over X. This algebra contains the empty set and is closed under the operations of taking complements in X, finite unions, and finite intersections.

## Properties

A field of sets must satisfy the following properties:

1. **Closed under Complementation**: X∖F∈$F$ for all F∈$F$.
2. **Contains the Empty Set**: ∅∈$F$.
3. **Closed under Binary Unions**: F∪G∈$F$ for all F,G∈$F$.
4. **Closed under Binary Intersections**: F∩G∈F for all F,G∈$F$.

## Role in Boolean Algebras

Fields of sets play an essential role in the representation theory of Boolean algebras. Every Boolean algebra can be represented as a field of sets.

## Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Boolean Algebra]]**: Fields of sets are closely related to Boolean algebras, as they can represent any Boolean algebra.
- **[[Measure Theory]]**: In measure theory, a field of sets that is closed under countable unions and intersections is called a σ-field.
- **[[Set Theory]]**: The concept is a specialized structure within set theory, focusing on subsets and their algebraic properties.
