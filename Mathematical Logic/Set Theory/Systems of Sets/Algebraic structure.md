Множина E називається одиницею системи множин Φ, якщо вона належить Φ i якщо для довiльної A ∈ Φ справедлива рiвнiсть A ∩ E = A. Кiльце множин iз одиницею називається **алгеброю**.

## Definition

An **Algebraic Structure** consists of a non-empty set AA (referred to as the underlying set, carrier set, or domain), a collection of operations on AA (typically binary operations like addition and multiplication), and a finite set of identities or axioms that these operations must satisfy.

## Key Concepts

### Operations

- **Unary Operations**: Operations that take only one argument.
- **Binary Operations**: Operations that combine two elements of a set to produce a third element of the same set.
- **Higher-Arity Operations**: Operations that combine more than two elements.

### Axioms

- **Equational Axioms**: Axioms often have the form of identities, i.e., equations that must hold true when variables are replaced by arbitrary elements of the algebraic structure.
- **Existential Axioms**: Axioms that contain an existential clause, which can often be replaced by introducing further operations.
- **Non-Equational Axioms**: Axioms that can be any first-order formula, involving logical connectives and quantifiers.

### Common Algebraic Laws

- **Associativity**: (x∗y)∗z=x∗(y∗z)(x∗y)∗z=x∗(y∗z)
- **Commutativity**: x∗y=y∗xx∗y=y∗x
- **Distributivity**: x∗(y+z)=(x∗y)+(x∗z)x∗(y+z)=(x∗y)+(x∗z)

## Types of Algebraic Structures

- **Group-like Structures**: Include monoids, groups, and abelian groups.
- **Ring-like Structures**: Include rings, commutative rings, and fields.
- **Lattice Structures**: Include lattices, distributive lattices, and Boolean algebras.
- **Module and Vector Spaces**: Include modules over rings and vector spaces over fields.
