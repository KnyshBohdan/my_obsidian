Mathematical Logic is the study of formal logic within the context of mathematics. It serves as a bridge between abstract reasoning and mathematical rigor, providing the tools to understand the structure and consistency of mathematical systems.

## Definition

Mathematical Logic encompasses several major subareas, including:

- **Model Theory**: Studies the relationships between formal languages and their interpretations.
    
- **Proof Theory**: Focuses on the nature of mathematical reasoning, including the structure and justification of mathematical arguments.
    
- **Set Theory**: Deals with the study of sets, or collections of objects.
    
- **Recursion Theory**: Also known as computability theory, it investigates what can be computed and what cannot.
    

## Key Concepts

- **Formal Systems**: A set of axioms and rules of inference used to derive theorems.
    
- **Expressive Power**: The ability of a logical system to capture mathematical or other concepts.
    
- **Deductive Power**: The ability of a logical system to derive new truths from existing ones.
    

## Applications

- **Computer Science**: Formal methods, algorithms, and computational complexity.
    
- **Philosophy**: Foundations of mathematics, epistemology.
    
- **Linguistics**: Formal languages, syntax and semantics.
    

## Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Set Theory]]**: Mathematical Logic often employs set theory for foundational work.
    
- **[[Category Theory]]**: Although not strictly a part of mathematical logic, category theory provides alternative foundational systems.
    
- **[[Computational Complexity]]**: Sometimes considered a part of mathematical logic, it deals with the resources required for computation.
    
- **[[Philosophy of Mathematics]]**: Explores the philosophical assumptions and implications of mathematical logic.
