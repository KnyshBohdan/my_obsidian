Formal languages serve as the backbone for various disciplines like computer science, mathematics, and linguistics. They consist of a set of words formed from an alphabet according to specific rules, providing a structured way to represent computational problems, programming languages, and even natural languages.

#### Definition

A formal language LL over an alphabet Σ is a subset of Σ∗, where Σ∗ is the set of all possible strings over Σ. The language is defined by a set of rules or a formal grammar, such as a regular grammar or a context-free grammar, which dictates what constitutes a well-formed word or formula in that language.

#### Examples

- A language over the alphabet Σ={0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,+,=} could include strings like "23+4=555" that represent well-formed addition equalities.
- A language could be as simple as L={a,b,ab,cba}, explicitly enumerating all well-formed words.

#### Properties

- **Expressivity**: Formal languages can be simple or complex, depending on the power of their generative grammar.
- **Recognizability**: Some languages are easily recognizable by machines, while others are not.
- **Infinite vs Finite**: Formal languages can be infinite, even if they are defined over a finite alphabet.

#### Applications

- **Programming Languages**: Syntax of programming languages is often defined using formal languages.
- **Computational Complexity**: Decision problems are often defined as formal languages.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Formal languages can model aspects of natural languages.

#### Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Automata Theory]]**: Formal languages are closely related to automata, which recognize or generate them.
- **[[Computational Complexity]]**: Complexity classes are often defined in terms of formal languages.
- **[[Mathematical Logic]]**: Formal languages are used to represent the syntax of axiomatic systems.
