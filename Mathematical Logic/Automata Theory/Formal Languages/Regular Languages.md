Regular languages are a class of formal languages that can be represented by regular expressions or recognized by finite automata. They are the simplest type of languages in the Chomsky hierarchy and serve as the foundation for more complex language classes.

#### Definition

A regular language LL over an alphabet ΣΣ is a language that can be defined by a regular expression or equivalently recognized by a deterministic or nondeterministic finite automaton. Mathematically, the collection of regular languages over an alphabet ΣΣ can be defined recursively. The equivalence between regular expressions and finite automata is encapsulated in Kleene's theorem.

#### Examples

1. **All finite languages**: Any language that consists of a finite set of strings is regular.
2. **Even number of a's**: The language consisting of all strings over the alphabet {a,b}{a,b} that contain an even number of aa's.
3. **Empty string language**: {ϵ}=∅∗{ϵ}=∅∗ is a regular language.

#### Properties

- **Closure Properties**: Regular languages are closed under various operations like union, intersection, and complement.
- **Pumping Lemma**: All sufficiently long strings in a regular language can be "pumped" (have a middle section repeated) to produce a new string that is also part of the language.

#### Applications

- **Text Searching**: Regular expressions derived from regular languages are widely used in text searching algorithms.
- **Compiler Design**: Lexical analysis often uses regular languages to identify tokens in the source code.
- **Data Validation**: Regular expressions are used for input validation in various software applications.

#### Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Finite Automata]]**: Regular languages can be recognized by deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata.
- **[[Regular Expressions]]**: Regular languages can be defined using regular expressions.
- **[[Chomsky Hierarchy]]**: Regular languages are the simplest in the Chomsky hierarchy, classified as Type-3 grammars.
- **[[Pumping Lemma]]**: This lemma is used to describe an essential property of all regular languages and is often used to prove that a particular language is non-regular.
