Formal Language Theory is a mathematical framework for describing languages, both natural and artificial, in a rigorous way. It serves as the foundation for various areas such as compiler design, natural language processing, and cryptography.

#### Definition

A formal language L over an alphabet Σ is a subset of Σ∗, where Σ∗ is the set of all possible strings over Σ. In other words, a formal language is a set of words formed from an alphabet according to a specific set of rules known as a formal grammar.

#### Examples

- **Regular Languages**: Languages that can be described by regular expressions.
- **Context-Free Languages**: Languages that can be described by context-free grammars.

#### Properties

- **Expressive Power**: Different formalisms have varying levels of expressive power.
- **Recognizability**: Some languages are recognizable by finite automata, while others require more complex computational models.

#### Applications

- **Compiler Design**: Formal languages are used to define the syntax of programming languages.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Used to model aspects of natural languages.
- **Cryptography**: Used in the formulation of secure communication protocols.

#### Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Automata Theory]]**: Formal languages can be recognized by automata.
- **[[Computational Complexity]]**: Formal languages are used to define decision problems and complexity classes.
- **[[Context-Free Languages]]**: A specific type of formal language.
- **[[Regular Languages]]**: Another specific type of formal language.
- **[[Decidability]]**: Some formal languages are decidable, meaning there is an algorithm that can determine membership.
- **[[NP-Completeness]]**: Some decision problems related to formal languages are NP-complete.
