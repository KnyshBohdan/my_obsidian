Regular expressions, often abbreviated as regex or regexp, are sequences of characters that define a search pattern. They are widely used for string searching and manipulation tasks, such as "find" or "find and replace" operations.

#### Definition

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. This pattern can be used by string-searching algorithms for tasks like pattern matching, text retrieval, and input validation. The formal definition involves a set of rules for constructing regular expressions from the alphabet and operators like union, concatenation, and Kleene star.

#### Examples

1. **Basic Matching**: The regex `a.b` matches any string containing an "a" followed by any character and then a "b", like "acb", "a9b", etc.
2. **Character Classes**: `[a-z]` matches any lowercase letter, while `\d` matches any digit.
3. **Quantifiers**: `a*` matches zero or more consecutive "a" characters.

#### Properties

- **Metacharacters**: Characters like `.`, `*`, `+`, and `?` have special meanings and are used to define complex search patterns.
- **Greedy vs Lazy Matching**: By default, quantifiers are greedy, meaning they try to match as much text as possible. Adding a `?` after the quantifier makes it lazy.

#### Applications

- **Text Editors**: For search and replace functionalities.
- **Data Validation**: In web forms, emails, and other input fields.
- **Programming Languages**: Many languages like Python, Java, and Perl have built-in support for regular expressions.
