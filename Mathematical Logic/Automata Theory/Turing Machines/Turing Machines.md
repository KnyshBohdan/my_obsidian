A Turing Machine is an abstract mathematical model that serves as a foundational concept for understanding computation. It manipulates symbols on an infinite tape based on a set of rules, and despite its simplicity, it can simulate any computer algorithm.

#### Definition

A Turing Machine is defined as a 7-tuple (Q,Σ,Γ,q0​,A,δ,b) where:

- Q is a finite set of states.
- Σ is a finite set of input symbols.
- Γ is a finite set of tape symbols, where Σ⊆Γ.
- q0​ is the initial state.
- A is the set of accepting states.
- δ:Q×Γ→Q×Γ×{L,R} is the transition function.
- bb is the blank symbol, b∈Γ.

#### Examples

1. **Binary Addition**: A Turing Machine can be designed to add two binary numbers and provide the sum as output on the tape.

#### Properties

- **Universality**: A Universal Turing Machine (UTM) can simulate any other Turing Machine.
- **Turing Completeness**: A system or language that can simulate a Turing Machine is said to be Turing complete.
- **Halting Problem**: It is generally undecidable to determine whether a given Turing Machine will halt on a particular input.

#### Applications

- **Theory of Computation**: Turing Machines are used to prove various properties about algorithms, computational complexity, and decidability.
- **Computer Science Education**: They are often taught to computer science students to provide a fundamental understanding of computation.

#### Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Finite Automata]]**: Turing Machines generalize the concept of finite automata and can perform more complex tasks.
- **[[Formal Language Theory]]**: Turing Machines can recognize recursively enumerable languages.
- **[[Computability Theory]]**: They are central to discussions about what can and cannot be computed.
