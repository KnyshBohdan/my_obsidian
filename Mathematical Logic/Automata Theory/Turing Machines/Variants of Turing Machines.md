Variants of Turing Machines are specialized or generalized forms of the basic Turing Machine model. These variants help in understanding specific computational phenomena, such as randomness, quantum effects, and parallelism.

#### Types of Variants

1. **Probabilistic Turing Machine**: This is a non-deterministic Turing Machine that makes transitions based on some probability distribution. It can have stochastic results, meaning it may produce different outcomes on the same input during different runs. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_Turing_machine)
    
2. **Quantum Turing Machine (QTM)**: This abstract machine models the effects of a quantum computer. It generalizes classical Turing Machines by replacing internal states with states in a Hilbert space and transition functions with unitary matrices.

3. **Universal Turing Machine (UTM)**: A UTM can simulate any other Turing Machine. It serves as a standard against which to compare computational systems. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Turing_machine)
    

#### Properties

- **Computational Power**: Some variants, like the Quantum Turing Machine, potentially offer greater computational power than classical Turing Machines.
    
- **Stochastic Behavior**: Probabilistic Turing Machines introduce the concept of randomness into computation.
    
- **Universality**: UTMs are capable of computing any computable sequence, making them a foundational concept in computer science.
    

#### Applications
