Automata Theory serves as the cornerstone of theoretical computer science, focusing on the study of abstract machines, or automata, and the computational problems they can solve. Originating from the Greek word αὐτόματος, meaning "self-acting, self-willed, self-moving," this field bridges the gap between mathematical logic and computer science, offering a framework to understand how machines or computing devices operate.

#### Definition

Automata Theory is the study of abstract machines and automata, as well as the computational problems that can be solved using them. An automaton is an abstract self-propelled computing device that follows a predetermined sequence of operations automatically. Automata can be finite or infinite, deterministic or nondeterministic, and are often classified by the class of formal languages they can recognize.

#### Examples

- **Finite-State Machine (FSM)**: An automaton with a finite number of states, often used in modeling and simulation.
- **Pushdown Automata**: Used in parsing context-free languages.
- **Turing Machine**: A mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine.

#### Properties

- **Transition Function**: Determines the next state based on the current state and input symbol.
- **State Space**: The set of all possible states the automaton can be in.
- **Input Alphabet**: The set of symbols that the automaton can read as input.

#### Applications

- **Compiler Construction**: Automata are used in the lexical and syntax analysis phases of a compiler.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Automata theory is used in the development of AI algorithms.
- **Formal Verification**: Used to prove the correctness of systems.

#### Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Formal Language Theory]]**: Automata are used as finite representations of formal languages.
- **[[Computational Complexity]]**: Automata theory helps in understanding the complexity of algorithms.
- **[[Mathematical Logic]]**: The field has close connections to mathematical logic, particularly in the use of formal methods.
