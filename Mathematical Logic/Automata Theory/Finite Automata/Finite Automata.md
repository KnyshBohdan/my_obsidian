Finite Automata are abstract computational models used to recognize patterns within input taken from some character set. They serve as the building blocks for various types of parsers, text search tools, and many other software systems. Simply put, they are machines that move through a series of states based on input symbols to either accept or reject a string.

## Definition

A Finite Automaton (FA) is a mathematical model of computation defined as a 5-tuple (Q,Σ,δ,q0,F), where:

- Q is a finite set of states.
- Σ is a finite input alphabet.
- δ:Q×Σ→Q is the state transition function.
- q0∈Q is the initial state.
- F⊆Q is the set of accepting states.

## Additional Information

Finite Automata come in two primary types: Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA). Both types are used in various applications like lexical analysis, pattern matching, and network protocols.

## Examples

1. **Turnstile System**: A simple turnstile system can be modeled using a finite automaton with states representing 'Locked' and 'Unlocked' conditions.
    
2. **Text Search**: Finite automata can be used to find occurrences of a substring within a larger string.
    

## Properties

- **Deterministic or Nondeterministic**: Finite automata can be either deterministic or nondeterministic.
- **Acceptance Criterion**: A string is accepted if the automaton ends in an accepting state after reading the entire string.

## Applications

- **Compiler Design**: Used in lexical analysis phase.
- **Text Editors**: For search and replace functionality.
- **Network Protocols**: For packet recognition and routing.
