A Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) is a finite-state machine that accepts or rejects a given string of symbols by traversing a uniquely determined sequence of states. Formally, a DFA is defined as a 5-tuple (Q,Σ,δ,q0,F), where:

- Q is a finite set of states.
- Σ is a finite alphabet.
- δ:Q×Σ→Q is the transition function.
- q0∈Q is the initial state.
- F⊆Q is the set of accepting states.

## Additional Information

The term "deterministic" implies that the automaton's next state is uniquely determined by its current state and the input symbol. DFAs are often used in lexical analysis, pattern matching, and other computational problems.

## Examples

1. **Binary String Acceptance**: A DFA can be designed to accept strings of binary numbers that are divisible by 3. The states can represent the remainder when divided by 3, and transitions can be designed accordingly.
    
2. **Email Validation**: A DFA can be used to validate the syntax of an email address by transitioning through states that represent valid characters at each position in the string.
    

## Properties

- **Determinism**: For each state and each input symbol, there is exactly one transition to another state.
- **Acceptance Criterion**: A string is accepted if the DFA ends in an accepting state after reading the entire string.

## Applications

- **Lexical Analysis**: In compilers, DFAs are used to tokenize the source code.
- **Pattern Matching**: DFAs are used in regular expression engines.
- **Data Validation**: For validating formats like email addresses, URLs, etc.
