Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFAs) are like DFAs but with a twist: they can exist in multiple states at once. This makes them more flexible but also more complex to understand. They are used in various computational tasks, including pattern matching and text processing.

## Definition

An NFA is formally represented by a 5-tuple (Q,Σ,δ,q0,F), where:

- Q is a finite set of states.
- Σ is a finite alphabet.
- δ:Q×Σ→P(Q) is the state transition function, mapping to the power set of QQ.
- q0∈Q is the initial state.
- F⊆Q is the set of accepting states.

## Additional Information

NFAs were introduced in 1959 by Michael O. Rabin and Dana Scott, who also showed their equivalence to DFAs. NFAs are used in the implementation of regular expressions through algorithms like Thompson's construction.

## Examples

1. **Pattern Matching**: An NFA can be used to find all occurrences of a pattern within a text, allowing for more flexible matching rules than a DFA.
    
2. **Regular Expressions**: NFAs are often used to implement regular expression matching in programming languages.
    

## Properties

- **Nondeterminism**: NFAs can transition to multiple states for a given input.
- **Equivalence to DFA**: Every NFA can be converted to an equivalent DFA using the subset construction algorithm.

## Applications

- **Text Search Engines**: For rapid pattern matching.
- **Compiler Construction**: In lexical analysis and parsing phases.

## Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)]]**: Every DFA is also an NFA, but not vice versa.
- **[[Regular Languages]]**: Like DFAs, NFAs recognize exactly the set of regular languages.
- **[[Automata Theory]]**: NFAs are a crucial concept in automata theory, which explores different types of computational models.
