Decidability is a pivotal concept in logic and theoretical computer science that deals with the existence of an effective method to solve a decision problem. In simpler terms, a problem is decidable if there's a way to always arrive at a correct yes-or-no answer in a finite amount of time.

#### Definition

In logic, a true/false decision problem is said to be decidable if there exists an effective method for deriving the correct answer. Zeroth-order logic (propositional logic) is decidable, whereas first-order and higher-order logic are generally not. A logical system is considered decidable if there is an effective method for determining whether arbitrary formulas are theorems of the system.

#### Examples

- **Propositional Logic**: Decidable because the truth-table method can be used to determine logical validity.
- **First-Order Logic**: Not decidable in general, especially when the signature includes equality and at least one other predicate with two or more arguments.

#### Properties

- **Effective Method**: A well-defined procedure that returns a correct answer in finite time.
- **Undecidability**: Some problems are proven to be undecidable, meaning no effective method can exist for them.

#### Applications

- **Compiler Construction**: Decidability is crucial for syntax and semantic analysis.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Decidability issues often arise in AI algorithms.
- **Formal Verification**: Decidability is essential for proving the correctness of systems.
