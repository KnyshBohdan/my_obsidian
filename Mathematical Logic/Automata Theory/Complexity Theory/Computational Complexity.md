Computational complexity theory is a subfield of theoretical computer science and mathematics that focuses on classifying computational problems based on their resource usage, such as time and storage. The theory aims to understand the inherent difficulty of problems and the practical limits of what computers can and cannot do.

#### Definition

Computational complexity theory categorizes computational problems according to the amount of resources needed to solve them. These resources can include time (time complexity), storage (space complexity), communication (communication complexity), and other measures. The theory uses mathematical models of computation, like Turing machines, to quantify these complexities.

#### Examples

- **P vs NP Problem**: One of the most famous problems in computational complexity, asking whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified can also be quickly solved.
- **Decision Problems**: Problems that have a binary output, typically "yes" or "no". These are central objects of study in complexity theory.
- **Function Problems**: Problems where a single output is expected for every input, and the output is more complex than a binary answer.

#### Properties

- **Worst-Case Time Complexity**: Defined as the maximum time taken over all inputs of the same size. If this is a polynomial in the size of the input, then the algorithm is said to be a polynomial-time algorithm.
- **Cobham's Thesis**: Argues that a problem can be solved with a feasible amount of resources if it admits a polynomial-time algorithm.

#### Applications

- **Algorithm Analysis**: Complexity theory helps in understanding the efficiency of algorithms.
- **Optimization**: Used in various fields like operations research, data science, and artificial intelligence to find the most efficient algorithms.

#### Connection to Other Topics
