ChatGPT, I am working on building a comprehensive set of notes related to statistical concepts, theories, and distributions. I am using Obsidian, and I need your assistance in crafting detailed yet concise descriptions for each topic. Each note should include the small simple description, definition, some additional information, examples, applications, and connections to other relevant topics (some can be missed or added but connections must be always). Please ensure that mathematical expressions are provided in LaTeX format, and make use of Obsidian's linking feature to connect related notes. Before providing information on each topic, please consult authoritative sources to ensure accuracy. Here's the next topic I'd like you to cover: Image Proccessing 
Example:

Orthogonal projections are a fundamental concept in linear algebra, with applications in various fields such as computer graphics, signal processing, and statistics. Here's an exploration of orthogonal projections: ### Definition An orthogonal projection is a linear transformation from a vector space to itself, denoted by P, such that P∘P=P In the context of a Hilbert space (a complete inner product space), a projection is called an orthogonal projection if it satisfies: ⟨Px,y⟩=⟨x,Py⟩ for all vectors x,y∈V. ### Geometric Interpretation Orthogonal projection represents the "shadow" or "reflection" of a vector onto a subspace. It is the closest point in the subspace to the original vector. ### Examples 1. **Projection onto the xy-plane**: The function mapping the point (x,y,z) in three-dimensional space R3 to the point (x,y,0) is an orthogonal projection onto the xy-plane. This is represented by the matrix: $$P = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \ 0 \ 0 \\ 0 \ 1 \ 0 \\ 0 \ 0 \ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$ 2. **Projection onto a Line**: If uu is a unit vector on the line, the projection is given by the outer product: Pu=uuT ### Properties - **Idempotent**: $P^2=P$ - **Self-Adjoint**: An orthogonal projection is self-adjoint, meaning P=P∗. - **Bounded Operator**: An orthogonal projection is a bounded operator, meaning it maps bounded sets to bounded sets. - **Complementarity of Image and Kernel**: The image and kernel of a projection are complementary subspaces. ### Orthogonal Projections in Subspaces Orthogonal projections can be generalized to subspaces of arbitrary dimension. If u1,…,uk​ is an orthonormal basis of the subspace, the projection is given by: $P_A = \sum_{i}⟨u_i,\cdot ⟩u_i$ ### Applications - **Computer Graphics**: Used to project 3D objects onto a 2D screen. - **Statistics**: Used in regression analysis to project data points onto a subspace. - **Signal Processing**: Used to filter out noise by projecting signals onto a relevant subspace. ### Connection to Other Topics - **[[Inner Product Spaces]]**: Orthogonal projections are closely related to inner product spaces, where the concept of orthogonality is defined. - **[[Basis]]**: The projection onto a subspace can be defined using a basis of the subspace. - **[[Orthogonality]]**: Orthogonal projections are a specific case of projections where the range and kernel are orthogonal subspaces.
