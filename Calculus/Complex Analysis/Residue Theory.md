Residue Theory is a cornerstone in the field of complex analysis, offering a robust method for evaluating line integrals of analytic functions over closed curves. It is particularly useful for calculating real integrals and infinite series. The theorem generalizes Cauchy's integral theorem and is sometimes referred to as Cauchy's Residue Theorem.

#### Definition

The Residue Theorem states that for a simply connected open subset U of the complex plane containing a finite list of points a1,…,an​, and a function ff holomorphic on U∖{a1,…,an}, the line integral of ff around a closed rectifiable curve γ in U is equal to 2πi times the sum of residues at each point akak​, each counted as many times as γ winds around the respective point:

$$\oint_{\gamma} f(z) dz  = 2 \pi i  \sum_{k =1} ^{n} I (\gamma, a_k) Res(f, a_k)$$

#### Examples

1. **Real Axis Integral**: The integral $\int_{\infty}^{infty} \frac{e^{itx}}{x^2 + 1}$ can be evaluated using the Residue Theorem, yielding $\pi e^{-|t|}$ as the result.

#### Applications

- **Probability Theory**: Used in calculating the characteristic function of distributions.
- **Complex Integration**: Aids in solving integrals that are otherwise difficult to evaluate.
