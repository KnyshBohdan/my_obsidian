Conformal Mapping is a mathematical technique used in complex analysis that transforms one complex plane into another while preserving angles. This powerful tool is particularly useful for simplifying complex problems in various fields like physics and engineering.

#### Definition

In mathematics, a conformal map is a function that locally preserves angles but not necessarily lengths. Formally, let U and V be open subsets of Rn. A function f:U→V is called conformal at a point u0​∈U if it preserves angles between directed curves through u0​, as well as preserving orientation. The transformation is conformal whenever the Jacobian derivative matrix at each point is a positive scalar times a rotation matrix.

#### Examples

1. **Möbius Transformation**: A map of the Riemann sphere onto itself is conformal if and only if it is a Möbius transformation.
2. **Exponential Function**: It is a holomorphic function with a nonzero derivative but is not one-to-one since it is periodic.

#### Applications

- **Physics and Engineering**: Used for solving problems that can be expressed in terms of functions of a complex variable yet exhibit inconvenient geometries.
- **Cartography**: Several named map projections, including the Mercator projection, are conformal.
- **Biomedical Sciences**: Used in brain mapping and genetic mapping.
