Complex Functions are functions that map complex numbers to complex numbers. They form the core of complex analysis and have applications in various scientific and engineering disciplines. These functions are often analytic, meaning they can be represented by a power series in a neighborhood of each point in their domain.

#### Definition

A complex function is a function f:C→C, where C is the set of complex numbers. The function is generally assumed to have a domain containing a nonempty open subset of the complex plane. Mathematically, a complex function f(z) can be written as f(x+iy)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y), where u(x,y) and v(x,y) are the real and imaginary parts of f(z), respectively.

#### Examples

1. **Exponential Function**: ez is an example of an entire function, meaning it is analytic everywhere in the complex plane.
2. **Trigonometric Functions**: sin⁡(z) and cos⁡(z) are also entire functions.

#### Applications

- **Physics**: Used in quantum mechanics and thermodynamics.
- **Engineering**: Applied in electrical and mechanical engineering.
- **Mathematics**: Important in number theory and algebraic geometry.
