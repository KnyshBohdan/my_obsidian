Complex Analysis is a branch of mathematical analysis that deals with functions of complex numbers. It has applications in various fields of mathematics, physics, and engineering. The theory is particularly concerned with analytic functions, which are functions that can be represented by a power series.

#### Definition

Complex Analysis studies functions f:C→C of a complex variable zz. These functions are often assumed to be analytic, meaning they are locally represented by a convergent power series. The central tool in complex analysis is the line integral, and one of the key results is the Cauchy-Riemann equations, which provide a characterization of analytic functions. The equations are:

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = - \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$$

where u(x,y) and v(x,y) are the real and imaginary parts of f(z), respectively.

#### Examples

1. **Exponential Function**: $e^z$ is an entire function, meaning it is analytic everywhere in the complex plane.
2. **Trigonometric Functions**: Functions like sin⁡(z) and cos(z) are also entire functions.

#### Applications

- **Physics**: Used in quantum mechanics and thermodynamics.
- **Engineering**: Finds applications in electrical and mechanical engineering.
- **Mathematics**: Important in number theory and algebraic geometry.
