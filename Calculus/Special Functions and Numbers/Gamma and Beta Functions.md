The Gamma and Beta functions are special functions that extend the concept of the factorial function to complex numbers and real numbers, respectively. They are ubiquitous in various fields such as calculus, mathematical analysis, statistics, and physics.

#### Definition:

- **Gamma Function**: The Gamma function Γ(z) is defined as

$$Г(z) = \int_{0}^{\infty} t^{z - 1}e^{-t}dt$$

for complex numbers z with a positive real part.

- **Beta Function**: The Beta function B(x,y) is often defined in terms of the Gamma function as

$$B(x, y) = \frac{Г(x)Г(y)}{Г(x + y)}$$
#### Explanation:

- **Gamma Function**: It serves as a continuous extension of the factorial function. For every positive integer n, Γ(n)=(n−1)!. It has no zeros and is defined for all complex numbers except the non-positive integers.
- **Beta Function**: It is closely related to the Gamma function and is often used in probability theory, number theory, and combinatorics.

#### Examples:

- **Gamma Function**: Γ(5)=4!=24
- **Beta Function**: B(2,3)=Γ(2)Γ(3)Γ(5)=1!×2!4!=112

#### Properties:

- **Gamma Function**: It satisfies the recurrence relation Γ(z+1)=zΓ(z) and has simple poles at zero and the negative integers.
- **Beta Function**: It is symmetric, B(x,y)=B(y,x), and satisfies B(x,y)=∫01tx−1(1−t)y−1 dt.

#### Applications:

- **Gamma Function**: Used in probability-distribution functions, combinatorics, and quantum physics.
- **Beta Function**: Used in statistics for various probability distributions like the Beta distribution.
