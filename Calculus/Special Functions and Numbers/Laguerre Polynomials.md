Laguerre Polynomials are a sequence of orthogonal polynomials that play a crucial role in mathematical physics, quantum mechanics, and approximation theory. They are particularly important for solving certain types of differential equations.

#### Definition:

The Laguerre Polynomials Ln(x) are defined by Rodrigues' formula:

$$L_n(x) = \frac{e^x}{n!} \frac{d^n}{d x^n} (x^n e^{-x})$$

The generalized Laguerre Polynomials $L_n^{(α)}(x)$ are given by:

$$L_n^{(\alpha)} (x) = \frac{(n + \alpha)!}{n!} \sum_{k = 0}^{n} \frac{(-1)^k n!}{k! (n - k)! (a + k 1)}x^k$$

#### Explanation:

The Laguerre Polynomials are solutions to the Laguerre's differential equation:

xy′′+(1−x)y′+ny=0

They are orthogonal with respect to the weight function e−x on the interval $[0,∞)$.

#### Examples:

- L0(x)=1
- L1(x)=1−x
- L2(x)=1−2x+x22

#### Properties:

- **Orthogonality**:

∫0∞e−xLn(x)Lm(x)dx=δnm​

- **Recurrence Relations**:

(n+1)Ln+1(x)=(2n+1−x)Ln(x)−nLn−1(x)
#### Applications:

- In quantum mechanics, they describe the wave function of the hydrogen atom.
- Used in approximation methods and numerical analysis.
