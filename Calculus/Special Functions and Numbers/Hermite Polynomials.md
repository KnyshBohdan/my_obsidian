Hermite polynomials are a classical sequence of orthogonal polynomials that arise in various fields such as signal processing, probability theory, physics, and numerical analysis. They were initially defined by Pierre-Simon Laplace and later studied in detail by Pafnuty Chebyshev and Charles Hermite.

#### Definition:

The Hermite polynomials can be defined in two different standardizations: the "probabilist's Hermite polynomials" Hen(x) and the "physicist's Hermite polynomials" Hn(x). The probabilist's Hermite polynomials are given by:

$$He_n (x) = (-1)^n e^{\frac{x^2}{2}} \frac{d^n}{d x^n} e^{- \frac{x^2}{2}}$$

The physicist's Hermite polynomials are defined as:

$$H_n = (-1)^n e^{x^2} \frac{d^n}{dx^n} e^{-x^2}$$

#### Explanation:

Hermite polynomials are solutions to specific differential equations and are orthogonal with respect to certain weight functions. They are particularly useful in quantum mechanics, where they describe the eigenstates of the quantum harmonic oscillator. They also appear in signal processing as Hermitian wavelets and in probability theory in the Edgeworth series.

#### Examples:

- **Quantum Harmonic Oscillator**: Eigenstates are represented using Hermite polynomials.
- **Signal Processing**: Used in wavelet transform analysis.
- **Probability Theory**: Used in the Edgeworth series for approximating probability distributions.

#### Properties:

- **Orthogonality**: Hermite polynomials are orthogonal with respect to specific weight functions.
- **Recurrence Relation**: They satisfy specific recurrence relations, making them easy to compute.
- **Symmetry**: Hn(−x)=(−1)nHn(x) and Hen(−x)=(−1)nHen(x).

#### Applications:

- **Physics**: In quantum mechanics, particularly in the study of the quantum harmonic oscillator.
- **Engineering**: In signal processing and control theory.
- **Mathematics**: In numerical analysis for Gaussian quadrature.
