## Definition

Calculus is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the study of rates of change (differential calculus) and the accumulation of quantities (integral calculus). It provides a tool for understanding how things change and accumulate, which is essential in virtually every field of science and engineering.

## Key Concepts

### Limits

The concept of a limit is fundamental in calculus. It provides a rigorous foundation for defining derivatives and integrals.

### Derivatives

The derivative measures how a function changes as its input changes. It is represented as dydxdxdy​ or f′(x)f′(x).

### Integrals

The integral is essentially the "opposite" of the derivative. It is used to find the area under a curve and can be thought of as the accumulation of quantities.

### Functions

Functions are mappings from one set to another that are used to model real-world situations in calculus.

### Series and Sequences

These are used to approximate functions and solve problems that cannot be solved through elementary antiderivatives.

## Applications

- **Physics**: Calculus is used to describe motion, electricity, heat, and even quantum mechanics.
    
- **Engineering**: Used in optimizing systems and solving problems related to motion, energy, and waves.
    
- **Economics**: Calculus can help understand rates of infection spread, model financial systems, or solve optimization issues.
