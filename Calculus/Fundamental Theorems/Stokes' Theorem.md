Stokes' Theorem, also known as the Kelvin–Stokes theorem, is a fundamental concept in vector calculus. It establishes a relationship between the line integral of a vector field around a closed loop and the flux of its curl through the surface enclosed by the loop. Essentially, it provides a way to evaluate integrals over a surface by examining the behavior of the vector field along the boundary of that surface.

## Definition

Mathematically, let Σ be a smooth oriented surface in R3 with boundary ∂Σ≡Γ. If a vector field F is defined and has continuous first-order partial derivatives in a region containing Σ, then the theorem can be stated as:

$$\int \int_{\Sigma} (\nabla \times F) d F  = \oint_{\partial \Sigma} F dГ$$
