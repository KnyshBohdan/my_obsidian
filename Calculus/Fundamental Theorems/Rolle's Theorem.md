Rolle's Theorem is a fundamental concept in calculus that provides conditions under which a function has a stationary point between two given points. This theorem serves as a stepping stone to more advanced theorems like the Mean Value Theorem and has applications in various fields such as optimization, physics, and engineering.

#### Definition:

Mathematically, Rolle's Theorem states that if a real-valued function f(x) is continuous on a closed interval $[a,b]$ and differentiable on the open interval (a,b), and if f(a)=f(b), then there exists a point c in (a,b) such that f′(c)=0.

#### Explanation:

The theorem essentially asserts that for any function that is continuous over a closed interval and differentiable over an open interval, if the function takes the same value at the endpoints of the interval, then there must be at least one point within the interval where the derivative is zero. This point is known as a stationary point.

#### Examples:

1. **Polynomial Function**: For f(x)=x3−3x2+2x, f(0)=f(1)=0. According to Rolle's Theorem, there exists a cc such that f′(c)=0.
2. **Trigonometric Function**: For f(x)=sin⁡(x) in the interval $[0,π]$, f(0)=f(π)=0. Rolle's Theorem guarantees a cc in (0,π) where f′(c)=0.

#### Properties:

1. **Continuity**: The function must be continuous on a closed interval.
2. **Differentiability**: The function must be differentiable on an open interval.
3. **Equal Values**: The function must take the same value at the endpoints of the interval.

#### Applications:

1. **Optimization**: Used to find local minima or maxima.
2. **Physics**: In kinematics to find points of zero velocity.
3. **Engineering**: In control systems to analyze stability.
