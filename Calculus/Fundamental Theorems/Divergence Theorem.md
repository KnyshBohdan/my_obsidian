The Divergence Theorem, also known as Gauss's theorem or Ostrogradsky's theorem, is a fundamental theorem in vector calculus. It establishes a relationship between the flux of a vector field across a closed surface and the divergence of the field within the volume enclosed by the surface. Essentially, it quantifies how much of a field is originating from a volume in space.

#### Definition

Mathematically, the Divergence Theorem is stated as follows:

$$\int \int \int_V (\nabla \times F) dV = \int \int _S (F \hat{n}) dS$$

Here, V is a volume in Rn bounded by a closed surface S, F is a continuously differentiable vector field, and n^ is the outward-pointing unit normal vector at each point on S.

#### Explanation

In simpler terms, the theorem states that the total divergence (or "source strength") inside a volume VV is equal to the total flux across its boundary surface SS. In physical terms, it's like saying the sum of all sources inside a region gives the net flow out of that region.

#### Applications

- **Electrostatics**: Used to derive Gauss's law in electrostatics.
- **Fluid Dynamics**: Helps in understanding the flow of incompressible fluids.
- **Engineering**: Used in various fields of engineering for solving boundary value problems.
