In multivariable calculus, the study of limits and continuity can yield counterintuitive results not demonstrated by single-variable functions. For example, scalar functions of two variables may give different limits when approached along different paths.

#### Partial Differentiation

The partial derivative generalizes the notion of the derivative to higher dimensions. A partial derivative of a multivariable function is a derivative with respect to one variable with all other variables held constant.

#### Multiple Integration

Multiple integration expands the concept of the integral to functions of any number of variables. Double and triple integrals may be used to calculate areas and volumes of regions in the plane and in space.
