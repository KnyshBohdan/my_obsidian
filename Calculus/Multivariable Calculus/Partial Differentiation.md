Partial differentiation is a fundamental concept in calculus that extends the idea of a derivative to functions of multiple variables. It is crucial for understanding how a function changes with respect to one variable while keeping others constant. This technique is widely used in physics, engineering, economics, and other fields that involve multivariable functions.

#### Definition:

The partial derivative of a function f(x1,x2,…,xn) with respect to the variable xixi​ is defined as:

$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x_1, ..., x_{i - 1}, x_i + h, x_{i + 1}, x_n ) - f(x_1, ..., x_n)}{h}$$

#### Explanation:

In partial differentiation, all variables except the one of interest are held constant. This allows us to focus on how the function changes with respect to that specific variable. The notation ∂f∂xi∂xi​∂f​ signifies this type of derivative. The concept is particularly useful in vector calculus and differential geometry.

#### Examples:

1. For f(x,y)=x2+xy+y2, the partial derivative with respect to x is ∂f∂x=2x+y.
2. For g(x,y,z)=x2y+ez, the partial derivative with respect to z is ∂g∂z=ez.

#### Properties:

1. **Linearity**: Partial derivatives are linear operations.
2. **Clairaut's Theorem**: If all mixed second-order partial derivatives are continuous, they can be interchanged, i.e., ∂2f∂xi∂xj=∂2f∂xj∂xi∂xi​∂xj​∂2f​=∂xj​∂xi​∂2f​.

#### Applications:

1. **Physics**: Used in the formulation of physical laws involving multiple variables like temperature, pressure, and volume.
2. **Machine Learning**: Used in optimization algorithms like gradient descent.
