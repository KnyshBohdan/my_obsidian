Multiple integration is an extension of single-variable integration to functions of several variables. It is a cornerstone of multivariable calculus and is widely used in fields like physics, engineering, and economics. Multiple integrals can be double, triple, or even higher-dimensional, depending on the number of variables involved.

#### Definition:

A multiple integral is a definite integral of a function of several real variables, such as f(x,y) or f(x,y,z). For instance, a double integral over a region R in R2 is represented as:

$$\int \int_{R} f(x, y) dx dy$$

Triple integrals extend this to R3:

$$\int \int \int_{T} f(x, y, z) dx dy dz$$

#### Explanation:

Just as the definite integral of a positive function of one variable represents the area under the curve, the double integral of a positive function of two variables represents the volume under the surface. For more variables, multiple integrals yield hypervolumes of multidimensional functions. The domain of integration is often represented by nested integral signs, and the function and integrand arguments are placed in proper order.

#### Examples:

1. **Double Integral**: ∬R(x+y) dx dy over a rectangular region RR.
2. **Triple Integral**: ∭Txyz dx dy dz over a region TT in R3R3.

#### Properties:

1. **Fubini's Theorem**: The value of an integral is independent of the order of integrands under certain conditions.
2. **Linearity**: Multiple integrals have many properties common to those of single-variable integrals, such as linearity and commutativity.

#### Applications:

1. **Physics**: In calculating moments of inertia, electric and magnetic fields.
2. **Engineering**: In computational geometry and optimization problems.
