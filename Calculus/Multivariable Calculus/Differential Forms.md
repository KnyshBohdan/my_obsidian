Differential forms offer a unified framework for defining integrands over various geometric objects like curves, surfaces, and higher-dimensional manifolds. They are pivotal in fields such as geometry, topology, and physics. The concept was modernized by Élie Cartan and serves as a cornerstone in differential geometry.

#### Definition

In mathematics, a differential form is an algebraic construct that generalizes the concept of functions and vectors, allowing for a more natural formulation of integration and differentiation on manifolds. A k-form is an object that can be integrated over a kk-dimensional manifold and is homogeneous of degree kk in the coordinate differentials dx,dy,…

#### Examples

1. **1-form**: f(x)dx is a 1-form that can be integrated over an interval $[a,b]$ in the domain of f.
2. **2-form**: $f(x,y,z)dx∧dy+g(x,y,z)dz∧dx+h(x,y,z)dy∧dz$ can be integrated over a surface S.

#### Properties

- **Alternating Algebra**: $dy∧dx=−dx∧dy$ and $dx∧dx=0$.
- **Exterior Derivative**: Given a k-form ϕ, the exterior derivative produces a (k+1)-form dϕ.

#### Applications

- **Geometry and Topology**: Used for defining integrals over manifolds.
- **Physics**: Useful in electromagnetism and general relativity.
