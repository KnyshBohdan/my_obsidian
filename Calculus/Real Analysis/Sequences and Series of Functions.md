Sequences and series of functions extend the concept of sequences and series in real numbers to function spaces. They are crucial in understanding the convergence behavior of function approximations and are widely used in mathematical analysis, numerical methods, and even in machine learning algorithms.

#### Definition:

A sequence of functions {fn} is a list of functions f1,f2,f3,… defined on a common domain A into a metric space (T,ρ′). A series of functions is represented as $∑_{n=1}^{∞}f_n$​, where $f_n$ are the terms of the series.

#### Explanation:

Imagine a series of progressively better approximations to a complicated function. Each approximation f_n​ in the sequence gets closer to the actual function as n increases. The sequence {f_n​} may converge pointwise or uniformly to a function ff, depending on how the errors ρ′(fn(x),f(x)) behave as n→∞.

#### Examples:

- **Fourier Series**: Represents a function as an infinite sum of sines and cosines.
- **Taylor Series**: Expands a function into an infinite sum of polynomial terms.
- **Power Series**: A series of the form ∑n=0∞anxn.

#### Properties:

- **Pointwise Convergence**: fn​ converges pointwise to f if lim⁡n→∞fn(x)=f(x) for all x in the domain.
- **Uniform Convergence**: fnfn​ converges uniformly to ff if ∀ϵ>0,∃N such that ∀n>N,∀x in the domain, ρ′(fn(x),f(x))<ϵ.

#### Applications:

- **Numerical Analysis**: In solving differential equations and optimization problems.
- **Signal Processing**: In Fourier and wavelet transforms.
- **Machine Learning**: In approximating complex functions using simpler functions.
