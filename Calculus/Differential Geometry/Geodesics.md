Geodesics are fundamental concepts in the fields of geometry, general relativity, and differential geometry. They represent the shortest paths between points on a curved surface or, more generally, in a Riemannian manifold. Geodesics generalize the notion of "straight lines" in Euclidean geometry to curved spaces.

## Definition

In a Riemannian manifold MM with metric gg, a curve γ:$[a,b]$→M is called a geodesic if its acceleration is zero, i.e., if it satisfies the geodesic equation:

$$\nabla _{\dot{\gamma}}\dot{\gamma} = 0$$

Here, ∇ is the Levi-Civita connection associated with g, and γ˙​ is the velocity vector of the curve.

## Properties

- **Local Minimizer**: Geodesics locally minimize distance, meaning they are the shortest path between nearby points.
    
- **Affine Parameterization**: Geodesics can be parameterized "with constant speed," meaning the distance along the curve is proportional to the parameter.
    
- **Vanishing Geodesic Curvature**: In a Riemannian manifold or submanifold, geodesics are characterized by having vanishing geodesic curvature.
    

## Examples

1. **Great Circles on a Sphere**: The shortest path between two points on a sphere is a segment of a great circle.
    
2. **Straight Lines in Euclidean Space**: In flat Euclidean space, geodesics are just straight lines.
    

## Applications

- **General Relativity**: Geodesics describe the motion of free-falling particles in a curved spacetime.
    
- **Navigation**: On Earth, geodesic calculations are essential for determining the shortest path between two geographical locations.
    
- **Computer Graphics**: In mesh processing and 3D modeling, geodesic distances are often computed.
