Differential geometry is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the study of smooth shapes and spaces, known as smooth manifolds. It employs techniques from differential calculus, integral calculus, linear algebra, and multilinear algebra. The field has applications in various domains such as physics, engineering, and computer science.

#### Definition

Differential geometry studies the geometry of smooth manifolds using techniques from differential and integral calculus as well as linear and multilinear algebra. It explores geometric structures on differentiable manifolds, which can define notions of size, distance, shape, volume, and other rigidifying structures. For instance, in Riemannian geometry, distances and angles are specified, while in symplectic geometry, volumes may be computed.

#### Properties

- **Smooth Manifolds**: These are the primary objects of study in differential geometry. They are spaces that locally resemble Euclidean space.
- **Geometric Structures**: These are additional layers of information that can be added to a smooth manifold, such as a metric tensor in Riemannian geometry.
- **Intrinsic vs Extrinsic**: Intrinsic properties are those that depend only on the manifold itself, not on its embedding in another space. Extrinsic properties do depend on this embedding.

#### Examples

1. **Curves and Surfaces**: The simplest examples of smooth spaces are plane and space curves and surfaces in three-dimensional Euclidean space.
2. **Riemannian Manifolds**: These are smooth manifolds equipped with a Riemannian metric, which allows for the measurement of angles and distances.

#### Applications

- **Physics**: Used extensively in general relativity and quantum field theory.
- **Engineering**: Applied in control theory and computer graphics.
- **Machine Learning**: Recently finding applications in algorithms that operate on manifold-like data structures.

#### Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Calculus]]**: The foundational techniques come from differential and integral calculus.
- **[[Linear Algebra]]**: Techniques from linear algebra are essential for understanding tangent spaces and transformations.
- **[[Topology]]**: Differential topology is often considered a subset or closely related field to differential geometry.
- **[[Differential Equations]]**: Geometric aspects of differential equations are studied in differential geometry.
- **[[Complex Analysis]]**: Some techniques and problems overlap with those in complex analysis.
