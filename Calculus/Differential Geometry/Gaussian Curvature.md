Gaussian curvature is a central concept in differential geometry, describing the intrinsic curvature of a smooth surface in three-dimensional space. Unlike other measures of curvature, Gaussian curvature is intrinsic, meaning it depends solely on the surface itself and not on its embedding in a higher-dimensional space. It is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, who published the Theorema Egregium in 1827, highlighting its intrinsic nature.

## Definition

The Gaussian curvature K at a point on a smooth surface is defined as the product of the principal curvatures κ1κ1​ and κ2​ at that point:

K=κ1κ2

## Properties

- **Significance of Sign**: The sign of the Gaussian curvature can be used to characterize the surface. Positive Gaussian curvature indicates elliptical points, while negative Gaussian curvature indicates hyperbolic points. Points with zero Gaussian curvature are called parabolic.
    
- **Intrinsic Nature**: Gaussian curvature is an intrinsic property, meaning it is determined solely by measurements within the surface, independent of its embedding in Euclidean space.
    
- **Theorema Egregium**: This theorem by Gauss states that Gaussian curvature can be determined entirely by measuring angles, distances, and their rates on a surface, without reference to the embedding space.
    

## Examples

- **Sphere**: A sphere of radius r has a constant Gaussian curvature of 1/r^2​ everywhere.
    
- **Flat Plane**: A flat plane has a Gaussian curvature of zero everywhere.
    
- **Hyperboloid**: This surface has negative Gaussian curvature.
    

## Applications

- **General Relativity**: Gaussian curvature is crucial in the geometry of curved spacetime.
    
- **Cartography**: The intrinsic nature of Gaussian curvature implies that no flat map can perfectly represent the Earth's surface.
