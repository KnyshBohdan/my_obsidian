Curves and surfaces are fundamental objects in differential geometry. While curves are one-dimensional smooth manifolds embedded in a higher-dimensional space, surfaces are two-dimensional. They serve as the building blocks for more complex geometric structures and have applications in various fields like physics, engineering, and computer graphics.

#### Definition

- **Curve**: A curve is a one-dimensional smooth manifold that can be embedded in a higher-dimensional space. Mathematically, it can be represented as a function γ:I→Xγ:I→X, where II is an interval and XX is the ambient space.
    
- **Surface**: A surface is a two-dimensional smooth manifold that can also be embedded in a higher-dimensional space. It can be locally represented using two parameters, often denoted as uu and vv.
    

#### Properties

- **Smoothness**: Curves and surfaces in differential geometry are usually required to be smooth, meaning they can be differentiated multiple times.
    
- **Tangents**: The concept of a tangent line to a curve or a tangent plane to a surface is fundamental in understanding their geometry.
    
- **Regular vs Non-Regular**: A curve is said to be regular if its derivative never vanishes. A non-regular curve may have points where it slows down or backtracks.
    

#### Examples

1. **Line**: The simplest curve, represented by a linear equation.
    
2. **Plane**: The simplest surface, represented by a linear equation in three variables.
    
3. **Helix**: A curve in three-dimensional space that resembles a spring.
    
4. **Sphere**: A surface in three-dimensional space defined by all points equidistant from a given point.
    

#### Applications

- **Physics**: Used in theories like general relativity.
    
- **Engineering**: Important in CAD and robotics.
    
- **Computer Graphics**: Used in rendering realistic images.
