The Comparison Test is a mathematical technique used to determine the convergence or divergence of infinite series. It is particularly useful when the series in question is complex, and direct methods are not easily applicable. The test has two main variants: the Limit Comparison Test and the Direct Comparison Test.

#### Definition:

- **Direct Comparison Test**: Given two series ∑an​ and ∑bn where 0≤an≤bn for all n,
    - If ∑bn​ is convergent, then ∑an​ is also convergent.
    - If ∑an is divergent, then ∑bn​ is also divergent.
- **Limit Comparison Test**: Given two series ∑an​ and ∑bn with an,bn>0, consider $\lim_{⁡n→∞}a_nb_n=L$,
    - If 0<L<∞, then either both series converge or both diverge.

#### Explanation:

Imagine you have a series whose terms are difficult to sum directly. The Comparison Test allows you to compare this series with another simpler series whose convergence behavior is known. If the simpler series converges, then so does the complex series, and vice versa.

#### Examples:

- **Direct Comparison**: To test ∑1n2+1∑n2+11​, compare it with ∑1n2∑n21​ which is known to converge.
- **Limit Comparison**: To test ∑nn2+1∑n2+1n​, use ∑nn2∑n2n​ for comparison.

#### Properties:

- **Applicability**: The test is most effective when the series in question and the comparison series are similar in behavior.
- **Limitations**: The test cannot be applied if the terms of the series are not all positive.

#### Applications:

- **Calculus**: In evaluating improper integrals.
- **Mathematical Analysis**: In studying the properties of functions.
- **Engineering**: In analyzing the stability of systems.
