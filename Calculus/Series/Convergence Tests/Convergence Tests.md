Convergence tests are mathematical criteria used to determine the convergence, conditional convergence, absolute convergence, or divergence of an infinite series. These tests are fundamental in calculus and mathematical analysis, serving as the backbone for understanding the behavior of series.

#### Definition:

Convergence tests are a set of methods that apply various mathematical conditions to an infinite series ∑n=1∞an∑n=1∞​an​ to ascertain its behavior. Each test has its own specific mathematical formulation, often involving limits, inequalities, or integrals.

#### Explanation:

Convergence tests are designed to analyze the properties of an infinite series to determine whether it converges to a finite value or diverges. These tests often involve taking limits, comparing with other known series, or even integrating functions that are related to the series.

#### Examples:

- **Ratio Test**: $\lim_{⁡n→∞}|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}​∣$
- **Root Test**: $\limsup_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{|a_n|}$
- **Integral Test**: Comparison with an integral ∫f(x) dx
- **Direct Comparison Test**: ∣an∣≤∣bn∣
- **Limit Comparison Test**: $\lim⁡_{n→∞}\frac{a_n}{b_n}$

#### Properties:

- **Inconclusiveness**: Some tests may be inconclusive, requiring further analysis.
- **Absolute vs Conditional Convergence**: Some tests can determine absolute convergence, while others can only determine conditional convergence.

#### Applications:

- **Mathematical Analysis**: For studying the convergence of series.
- **Engineering**: In signal processing and control systems.
- **Computer Science**: In algorithms that involve series calculations.
