A power series is a mathematical construct that represents functions as infinite sums of monomials. It serves as a cornerstone in mathematical analysis, particularly in the study of infinitely differentiable functions. Power series are ubiquitous in fields like physics, engineering, and computer science.

#### Definition:

A power series in one variable xx is defined as:

$$\sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} a_n (x - c)^n$$

where an​ represents the coefficient of the nth term and cc is a constant known as the center of the series.

#### Explanation:

Power series can be thought of as "polynomials of infinite degree," providing approximations to more complex functions. They are particularly useful for functions that are difficult to integrate or differentiate. The series converges to the function within a certain radius around the center cc.

#### Examples:

- **Exponential Function**: $e^x=∑_{n=0}^{∞}\frac{x_n}{n!}$
- **Sine Function**: $sin⁡(x)=∑_{n=0}^{∞}\frac{(−1)^n x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}$
#### Properties:

- **Radius of Convergence**: A power series converges within a certain radius rr around the center cc.
- **Analyticity**: Functions represented by a power series are analytic within the radius of convergence.

#### Applications:

- **Function Approximation**: Used in numerical methods to approximate complex functions.
- **Engineering**: Employed in signal processing and control theory.
- **Combinatorics**: Used as generating functions to solve combinatorial problems.
