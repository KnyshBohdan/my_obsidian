Sequences and series are foundational concepts in mathematics that deal with ordered lists of elements and their summation, respectively. They are pivotal in various branches of mathematics such as calculus, mathematical analysis, and even in applied fields like physics, computer science, and finance.

#### Definition:

- **Sequence**: An ordered list of elements a1,a2,a3,… often denoted as (an), where n is an index that runs through some subset of integers.
- **Series**: The sum of the terms of a sequence, represented as ∑i=1∞ai or a1+a2+a3+…

#### Explanation:

- **Sequences**: Think of a sequence as a list of numbers generated by some rule. For example, the sequence of squares is 1,4,9,16,…
- **Series**: Imagine stacking up blocks where each block's height is given by a sequence. The total height of the stack is the sum of the series.

#### Examples:

- **Arithmetic Sequence**: an=a1+(n−1)d
- **Geometric Sequence**: an=a1×r(n−1
- **Arithmetic Series**: Sn=n2(a1+an)
- **Geometric Series**: Sn=a1(1−rn)1−r​ for r≠1

#### Properties:

- **Convergence**: A series is said to converge if the sum approaches a finite value. For example, the geometric series converges if ∣r∣<1∣r∣<1.
- **Divergence**: A series is said to diverge if the sum does not approach a finite value.

#### Applications:

- **Calculus**: Used in defining integrals and derivatives.
- **Computer Science**: Algorithms often use series for approximations.
- **Finance**: Used in calculating interests and annuities.
