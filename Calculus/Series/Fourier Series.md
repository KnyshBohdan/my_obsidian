Fourier Series is a mathematical tool for decomposing periodic functions into a sum of trigonometric functions, namely sines and cosines. This powerful technique is widely used in various fields such as signal processing, engineering, and physics to analyze periodic phenomena.

#### Definition:

A Fourier series represents a periodic function f(x) as an infinite sum of sines and cosines:

$$f(x)∼A_0 + \sum_{n = 1}^{∞}(A_ncos⁡(\frac{2πnx}{P})+B_nsin⁡(\frac{2πnx}{P}))$$

where A0,An,A0​,An​, and $B_n$​ are Fourier coefficients, and P is the period of the function.

#### Explanation:

The Fourier series allows us to express complex periodic functions in terms of simpler trigonometric functions. By doing so, it becomes easier to analyze and solve problems involving the original function. The Fourier coefficients An​ and Bn​ are determined by integrals involving the original function and trigonometric functions.

#### Examples:

- **Square Wave**: A square wave can be approximated by summing up its Fourier series terms.
- **Sawtooth Wave**: This function can also be represented as a Fourier series, where the coefficients are determined by specific integrals.

#### Properties:

- **Convergence**: The Fourier series may not always converge to the original function. However, for well-behaved functions like smooth functions, the series often converges.
- **Frequency Components**: The integer index nn in the Fourier series coefficients corresponds to the number of cycles in the function's period PP.

#### Applications:

- **Signal Processing**: Used for filtering and analyzing signals.
- **Heat Equation**: Originally used by Joseph Fourier to find solutions to the heat equation.
