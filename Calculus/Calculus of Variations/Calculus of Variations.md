## Definition

The Calculus of Variations deals with finding functions that optimize functionals. A functional is a mapping from a set of functions to real numbers. The primary objective is to find functions that make these functionals reach their maximum or minimum values. This is often expressed in terms of definite integrals involving functions and their derivatives. The Eulerâ€“Lagrange equation is a fundamental equation in this calculus, providing conditions for a function to optimize a given functional.

## Simple Example

Consider the problem of finding the shortest curve connecting two points. In a plane with no constraints, the solution is a straight line. However, if the curve must lie on a specific surface, the solution becomes more complex and is known as a geodesic.

## Applications

- **Physics**: Principles like the least action principle in mechanics are formulated using the calculus of variations.
    
- **Economics**: Used in optimization problems like maximizing utility functions subject to constraints.
    
- **Engineering**: Applied in optimizing shapes and materials in structures.
