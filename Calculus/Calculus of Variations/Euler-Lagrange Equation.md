The Euler-Lagrange equation is a fundamental equation in the calculus of variations, serving as the cornerstone for optimizing functionals. It is widely used in physics, engineering, and economics to find the function that minimizes or maximizes a given functional, essentially acting as the "equation of motion" for functionals.

#### Definition

The Euler-Lagrange equation is given by:

$$\frac{\partial L}{\partial f} - \frac{d}{dx} (\frac{\partial L}{\partial f'}) = 0$$

Here, L is the Lagrangian, a function of f, f′, and x, and f′ is the derivative of ff with respect to x.

#### Geometric Interpretation

The Euler-Lagrange equation provides the necessary condition for a function f(x) to be an extremum of the functional $I[f]$. It essentially states that if a function f(x) minimizes or maximizes a functional, then it must satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equation.

#### Examples

1. **Shortest Path**: In the case of finding the shortest path between two points, the Euler-Lagrange equation simplifies to the equation of a straight line.
2. **Brachistochrone Problem**: The problem of finding the curve of fastest descent is solved using the Euler-Lagrange equation.

#### Applications

- **Physics**: Used in Lagrangian mechanics to derive the equations of motion.
- **Economics**: Used in optimization problems like utility maximization.
- **Engineering**: Used in control theory and optimization problems.
