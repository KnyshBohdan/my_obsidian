Integral calculus is one of the two main branches of calculus, the other being differential calculus. It deals with the concept of integration, which is essentially the continuous analog of summation. Integral calculus is used to find areas under curves, volumes of solids of revolution, solutions to differential equations, and much more. It has applications in various fields such as physics, engineering, economics, and biology.

#### Definition:

In its most basic form, the integral of a function f(x) over an interval $[a,b]$ is denoted as:

$$∫_a^b f(x) dx$$

This is known as the definite integral, which represents the signed area under the curve of f(x) between aa and bb. The indefinite integral, denoted as ∫f(x) dx, represents a family of functions whose derivative is f(x).

#### Explanation:

Integration can be thought of as the reverse process of differentiation. While differentiation breaks down a function to understand its rate of change, integration aggregates or accumulates values. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus connects these two operations, stating that differentiation and integration are inverse operations under certain conditions.

#### Examples:

1. **Area under a Curve**: ∫01x2 dx=13∫01​x2dx=31​
2. **Volume of a Sphere**: V=∫0r4πx2 dx=43πr3V=∫0r​4πx2dx=34​πr3

#### Properties:

1. **Linearity**: ∫(af(x)+bg(x)) dx=a∫f(x) dx+b∫g(x) dx∫(af(x)+bg(x))dx=a∫f(x)dx+b∫g(x)dx
2. **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: ∫abf′(x) dx=f(b)−f(a)∫ab​f′(x)dx=f(b)−f(a)

#### Applications:

1. **Physics**: Used in calculating work done, electric and magnetic fields, etc.
2. **Engineering**: In signal processing, control theory, and fluid dynamics.
3. **Economics**: In calculating consumer and producer surplus, Gini coefficient, etc.
