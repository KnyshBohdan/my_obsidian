Euler's Formula for Complex Exponential is a mathematical gem that elegantly links trigonometry and complex numbers. Named after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, this formula is a powerful tool that simplifies the representation of complex numbers and has wide-ranging applications in engineering, physics, and signal processing.

### Definition

Euler's Formula is expressed as:

$$e^{i \theta} = \cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta)$$

Here, e is the base of the natural logarithm, ii is the imaginary unit, and Î¸ is the angle in radians.

### Properties and Characteristics

- **Eigenfunction of Differentiation**: The exponential function is an eigenfunction of the operation of differentiation, making it extremely useful in solving differential equations.
- **Phasor Analysis**: In electrical engineering and signal processing, Euler's formula is used to represent the impedance of a capacitor or an inductor.
- **Fourier Analysis**: Euler's formula is often used to express sinusoidal functions as the sum of exponential functions with imaginary exponents.

### Examples

1. **Complex Numbers**: Euler's formula can be used to represent any complex number in polar form.
2. **Differential Equations**: The formula simplifies solutions in differential equations, even if the final answer involves sine and cosine functions.
