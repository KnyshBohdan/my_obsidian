Integration by Discs, also known as the disc method, is a technique in integral calculus for calculating the volume of a solid of revolution. This method models the resulting three-dimensional shape as a stack of an infinite number of discs of varying radius and infinitesimal thickness. It is particularly useful for finding volumes when the axis of rotation is parallel to the axis along which you are integrating.

#### Definition:

The volume V of a solid of revolution generated by revolving a function f(x) around the x-axis is given by:

$$V = \pi \int_{a}^{b} [f(x)]^2 dx$$

Similarly, if the function to be revolved is a function of y, the volume is given by:

$$V = \pi \int_{c}^{d} [f(y)]^2 dy$$

#### Explanation:

The disc method involves slicing the volume into infinitesimally thin discs. Each disc's volume is πr2Δx or πr2Δy, depending on whether the function is in terms of xx or yy. The integral sums up these infinitesimal volumes to find the total volume of the solid.

#### Examples:

1. **Volume of a Cone**: V=π∫0hr2 dh, where r is the radius as a function of h.
2. **Washer Method**: To find the volume of a hollow solid, you can use the washer method, which is an extension of the disc method. The volume is given by π∫ab(RO(x)2−RI(x)2) dxπ∫ab​(RO​(x)2−RI​(x)2)dx, where RO(x)RO​(x) and RI(x)RI​(x) are the outer and inner radii, respectively.

#### Properties:

1. **Axis of Rotation**: The method is most straightforward when the axis of rotation is one of the coordinate axes.
2. **Washer Method**: An extension of the disc method to handle hollow solids.

#### Applications:

1. **Physics**: Useful in calculating volumes of objects with rotational symmetry.
2. **Engineering**: In structural analysis and fluid dynamics.
