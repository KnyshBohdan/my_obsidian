Integration by Parts is a fundamental technique in integral calculus that allows one to find the integral of a product of functions. This method is often employed to simplify complex integrals into more manageable forms. It is widely used in various fields such as physics, engineering, and economics for solving integrals that appear in real-world problems.

#### Definition:

The formula for integration by parts is given by:

$$\int u dv = uv - \int v dv$$

Here, u and dv are differentiable functions of x. The function uu is differentiated to get du, and dv is integrated to get v.

#### Explanation:

Integration by Parts can be thought of as the integral counterpart of the product rule for differentiation. It essentially breaks down a complex integral into simpler parts, making it easier to solve. The method involves choosing uu and dv wisely so that the resulting integral ∫v du is simpler than the original integral ∫u dv∫udv.

#### Examples:

1. **Integrating xcos⁡(x)**
    
    ∫xcos⁡(x) dx=xsin⁡(x)+cos⁡(x)+C
    
2. **Integrating ln⁡(x)ln(x)**
    
    ∫ln⁡(x) dx=x(ln⁡(x)−1)+C
    

#### Properties:

1. **Choice of uu and dvdv**: The choice of uu and dvdv is crucial for simplifying the integral.
2. **Recursive Application**: For integrals involving higher powers, the method can be applied recursively.

#### Applications:

1. **Physics**: Used in solving problems involving motion, energy, and waves.
2. **Engineering**: In electrical engineering for solving circuit problems.
3. **Economics**: In calculating consumer and producer surplus, among other applications.
