Integration by Cylindrical Shells, also known as the shell method, is a technique in integral calculus used for calculating the volume of a solid of revolution. Unlike disc integration, which integrates along the axis parallel to the axis of revolution, the shell method integrates along an axis perpendicular to the axis of revolution. This method is particularly useful in scenarios where the disc method is cumbersome or not applicable.

#### Definition:

The shell method is defined as follows: Consider a volume in three dimensions obtained by rotating a cross-section in the xy-plane around the yy-axis. If the cross-section is defined by the graph of a positive function f(x) on the interval [a,b][a,b], then the formula for the volume will be:

$$2 \pi \int_{a}^{b} x f(x) dx$$

If the function is of the coordinate y and the axis of rotation is the y-axis, then the formula becomes:

$$2 \pi \int_{a}^{b} y f(y) dy$$

#### Explanation:

The shell method approximates the volume of a solid by considering it as a collection of hollow cylinders (shells). As the walls of these cylinders get thinner, the approximation becomes more accurate, converging to the actual volume in the limit.

#### Examples:

1. **Volume of a Paraboloid**: If f(x)=x^2 and the interval is [0,1][0,1], then the volume can be calculated as $2π∫_0^1 ​xx^2dx$
2. **Volume with Hollow Core**: If the volume has a hollow core, the shell method can be used to find the volume of the inner and outer solids and then subtract them to get the desired volume.

#### Properties:

1. **Flexibility**: The shell method is versatile and can be applied even when the disc method is not suitable.
2. **Axis of Rotation**: The method can be adapted for different axes of rotation, not just the xx or yy-axis.

#### Applications:

1. **Physics**: In calculating volumes of objects with rotational symmetry.
2. **Engineering**: In structural analysis and fluid dynamics.
