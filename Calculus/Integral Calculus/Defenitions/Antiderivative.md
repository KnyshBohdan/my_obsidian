The antiderivative, also known as the indefinite integral or primitive function, is a fundamental concept in calculus. It is essentially the inverse operation of differentiation. Antiderivatives are crucial for solving problems related to areas, volumes, and other accumulative quantities. They are widely used in physics, engineering, and economics.

#### Definition:

Mathematically, an antiderivative F(x) of a function f(x) is a differentiable function whose derivative is equal to f(x). Symbolically, this relationship is expressed as F′(x)=f(x).

#### Explanation:

The antiderivative is the function that "undoes" the operation of differentiation. If you have a rate of change given by f(x), the antiderivative F(x) gives you the original function from which this rate of change is derived. The process of finding antiderivatives is known as antidifferentiation or indefinite integration.

#### Examples:

1. F(x)=x^3/3​ is an antiderivative of f(x)=x^2 since F′(x)=x^2.
2. F(x)=sin⁡(x)+C is an antiderivative of f(x)=cos⁡(x), where CC is the constant of integration.

#### Properties:

1. **Linearity**: The antiderivative is linear, meaning ∫(af(x)+bg(x)) dx=a∫f(x) dx+b∫g(x) dx.
2. **Constant of Integration**: Every antiderivative differs from another by a constant term C, known as the constant of integration.

#### Applications:

1. **Physics**: Used to find position from velocity or acceleration.
2. **Engineering**: In signal processing and control systems.
3. **Economics**: In calculating consumer and producer surplus.
