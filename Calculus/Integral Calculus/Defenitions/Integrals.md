Integrals are a cornerstone of calculus, serving as the continuous analog of summation. They are used to calculate areas, volumes, and other accumulative quantities. Integrals have broad applications in various scientific fields, including physics and engineering.

#### Definition:

The integral of a real-valued function f(x) with respect to a real variable xx over an interval [a,b][a,b] is denoted as:

$$\int_a^b f(x) dx$$

When the limits aa and bb are omitted, the integral is called an indefinite integral, represented as ∫f(x) dx.

#### Explanation:

Integrals can be categorized into definite and indefinite types. A definite integral calculates the signed area under the curve of a function between two points on the real line. In contrast, an indefinite integral represents a family of functions whose derivative is the given function. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculics connects definite integrals with differentiation, stating that differentiation and integration are inverse operations.

#### Examples:

1. **Definite Integral**: ∫01x2 dx=13∫01​x2dx=31​
2. **Indefinite Integral**: ∫x2 dx=x33+C∫x2dx=3x3​+C, where CC is the constant of integration.

#### Properties:

1. **Linearity**: ∫(af(x)+bg(x)) dx=a∫f(x) dx+b∫g(x) dx∫(af(x)+bg(x))dx=a∫f(x)dx+b∫g(x)dx
2. **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: ∫abf′(x) dx=f(b)−f(a)∫ab​f′(x)dx=f(b)−f(a)

#### Applications:

1. **Physics**: Used in calculating work done, electric and magnetic fields, etc.
2. **Engineering**: In signal processing, control theory, and fluid dynamics.
