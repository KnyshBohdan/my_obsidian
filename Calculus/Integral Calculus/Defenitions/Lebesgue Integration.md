Lebesgue Integration is a mathematical technique that extends the concept of integration to a broader class of functions and domains. Developed by French mathematician Henri Lebesgue, this integral is particularly useful in real analysis, probability theory, and other mathematical fields. Unlike the Riemann integral, which approximates the area under a curve using vertical rectangles, Lebesgue Integration uses horizontal "slabs," making it more flexible and applicable to a wider range of functions.

### Definition

The Lebesgue integral of a non-negative function ff is defined as the "area" under the curve of f with respect to a measure μ. In the simplest case, it can be thought of as the area between the graph of f and the x-axis. The integral is defined by summing up the areas of horizontal slabs under the graph of f, each of height dy, and width measured by μ.

### Properties and Characteristics

- **Flexibility**: Lebesgue integral can handle more irregular functions than the Riemann integral.
- **Limit Handling**: It interacts well with taking limits of sequences of functions, thanks to the monotone convergence theorem and dominated convergence theorem.
- **Measurable Functions**: Lebesgue's theory defines integrals for a class of functions called measurable functions.

### Examples

1. **Dirichlet Function**: This function is 0 where its argument is irrational and 1 otherwise. It doesn't have a Riemann integral, but its Lebesgue integral is zero.

### Applications

- **Probability Theory**: Used in the axiomatic theory of probability.
- **Real Analysis**: Provides a robust way to handle integrals in real analysis.
- **Fourier Analysis**: Useful in the study of Fourier series and Fourier transforms.
