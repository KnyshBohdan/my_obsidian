In mathematics, particularly in functional analysis, the spectrum of a bounded linear operator provides a generalization of eigenvalues for operators acting on general vector spaces. The spectrum is a set that encodes essential information about the operator and is crucial for understanding its properties and behavior.

### Definition

Let A be a bounded linear operator on a Banach space X. The spectrum σ(A)σ(A) of AA is defined as the set of all complex numbers λ for which the operator A−λI is not invertible, where II is the identity operator on XX.

Mathematically,

σ(A)={λ∈C:A−λI is not invertible}

### Types of Spectrum

1. **Point Spectrum**: The set of eigenvalues of A.
2. **Continuous Spectrum**: The set of λ for which A−λI is not invertible but has dense range.
3. **Residual Spectrum**: The set of λ for which A−λI has non-dense range.

### Applications

- **Quantum Mechanics**: Used in the study of quantum systems.
- **Differential Equations**: Helps in solving linear differential equations.
- **Signal Processing**: Used in the analysis of filters and systems.
