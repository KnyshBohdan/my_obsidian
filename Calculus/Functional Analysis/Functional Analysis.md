Functional Analysis is the branch of mathematical analysis that deals with vector spaces endowed with limit-related structures (e.g., inner product, norm, topology) and the linear functions (operators) defined on these spaces that respect these structures.

### Historical Context

The roots of functional analysis can be traced back to the study of function spaces and transformations like the Fourier transform. The term "functional" originated from the calculus of variations, where a function's argument is another function. The modern school of functional analysis was further developed by mathematicians like Stefan Banach, Fréchet, and Riesz.

### Key Concepts

- **Normed Vector Spaces**: These are complete vector spaces endowed with a norm, and they are known as Banach spaces. Hilbert spaces are a special case where the norm arises from an inner product.
    
- **Linear Operators**: These are mappings between Banach and Hilbert spaces that preserve the linear structure of the spaces.
    
- __C_-Algebras and Operator Algebras_*: These are algebras of operators on a Hilbert space, and they are central objects of study in functional analysis.
    

### Major Theorems

- **Hahn–Banach Theorem**: Allows the extension of bounded linear functionals defined on a subspace to the whole space.
    
- **Open Mapping Theorem**: States that a surjective continuous linear operator between Banach spaces is an open map.
    
- **Uniform Boundedness Principle**: Also known as the Banach–Steinhaus theorem, it asserts that pointwise boundedness is equivalent to uniform boundedness in operator norm.
    

### Applications

- **Quantum Mechanics**: Hilbert spaces are used in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics.
    
- **Machine Learning**: Functional analysis techniques are used in optimization problems in machine learning.
    
- **Partial Differential Equations**: Functional analysis provides the tools to study PDEs in an abstract setting.
    

### Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Differential Equations]]**: Functional analysis methods are often used to solve differential equations.
    
- **[[Topology]]**: The study of topological vector spaces is a key part of functional analysis.
    
- **[[Measure Theory]]**: Functional analysis extends measure, integration, and probability to infinite-dimensional spaces.
    
- **[[Linear Algebra]]**: While linear algebra deals with finite-dimensional spaces, functional analysis extends these ideas to infinite-dimensional spaces.
    
- **[[Calculus of Variations]]**: The term "functional" originally came from this field, and the methods are closely related.
    
- **[[Operator Theory]]**: This is a vast research area within functional analysis focusing on the properties of operators between various function spaces.
