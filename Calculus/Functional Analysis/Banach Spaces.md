Banach spaces are a cornerstone of functional analysis and have profound implications in various areas of mathematics, physics, and engineering. Named after the Polish mathematician Stefan Banach, these spaces generalize many of the properties of Euclidean spaces into more abstract settings.

### Definition

A Banach space is a complete normed vector space. Formally, a vector space VV over a field FF (usually RR or CC) equipped with a norm ∥⋅∥∥⋅∥ is called a Banach space if every Cauchy sequence in VV converges to an element in VV.

### Properties

- **Completeness**: By definition, a Banach space is complete, meaning every Cauchy sequence in the space converges to a limit within the space.
- **Linearity**: The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication are linear.
- **Norm**: The norm satisfies the properties of being non-negative, homogeneous, and satisfying the triangle inequality.

### Examples

1. **Euclidean Spaces**: RnRn with the Euclidean norm is a Banach space.
2. **Sequence Spaces**: lplp spaces for 1≤p<∞1≤p<∞ are Banach spaces.
3. **Function Spaces**: Spaces of continuous functions, C([a,b])C([a,b]), are Banach spaces under the sup-norm.

### Applications

- **Quantum Mechanics**: Used in the formulation of quantum states.
- **Differential Equations**: Provides the framework for existence and uniqueness theorems.
- **Optimization**: Used in convex optimization problems.

### Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Hilbert Spaces]]**: Every Hilbert space is a Banach space, but the converse is not true. Hilbert spaces have an inner product in addition to a norm.
- **[[Linear Operators]]**: Many important operators, like the Laplacian, are defined on Banach spaces.
- **[[Functional Analysis]]**: Banach spaces are a fundamental object of study in functional analysis.
- **[[Topology]]**: The concept of completeness makes Banach spaces a topological vector space.
