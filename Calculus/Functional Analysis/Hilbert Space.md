Hilbert Space is a generalization of Euclidean space that extends the methods of linear algebra and calculus to spaces that can be infinite-dimensional. It serves as the stage for quantum mechanics and is pivotal in the theories of partial differential equations, Fourier analysis, and more. It's a vector space equipped with an inner product that induces a distance function, making it a complete metric space.

### Definition

A Hilbert Space HH is a vector space over the real or complex numbers equipped with an inner product ⟨⋅,⋅⟩⟨⋅,⋅⟩ that satisfies the following properties:

1. **Conjugate Symmetry**: ⟨y,x⟩=⟨x,y⟩‾
2. **Linearity**: ⟨ax1+bx2,y⟩=a⟨x1,y⟩+b⟨x2,y⟩
3. **Positive Definiteness**: ⟨x,x⟩>0 if x≠0 and ⟨x,x⟩=0 if x=0

The space is complete, meaning every Cauchy sequence in HH converges to an element in HH.

### Examples

1. **Euclidean Space**: R3 with the dot product is a Hilbert Space.
2. **Sequence Space l2**: Consists of all sequences (z1,z2,…) of complex numbers such that $∑_{n=1}^{∞}∣z_n∣^2$ converges.

### Applications

- **Quantum Mechanics**: State vectors in quantum mechanics are elements of a Hilbert Space.
- **Signal Processing**: Fourier analysis, a tool in signal processing, uses Hilbert Spaces.
- **Partial Differential Equations**: Solutions often reside in appropriate Hilbert Spaces.
