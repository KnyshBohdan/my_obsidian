Limits are a foundational concept in mathematics, particularly in calculus and mathematical analysis. They are used to define other important concepts like continuity, derivatives, and integrals. Understanding limits is crucial for grasping how functions behave as their inputs approach a particular value.

#### Definition

In mathematics, a limit is the value that a function or sequence approaches as the input (or index) approaches a particular value. Formally, the limit of a function f(x)f(x) as xx approaches cc is denoted as lim⁡x→cf(x)=L. Here, L is the limit, and it means that for any arbitrarily small positive number ϵϵ, there exists a δ>0 such that if 0<∣x−c∣<δ, then ∣f(x)−L∣<ϵ.

#### Types of Limits

- **Finite Limits**: The limit is a real number.
- **Infinite Limits**: The limit is infinity, denoted as $\lim_{n \to \infty}a_n=\infty$.
- **One-sided Limits**: Limits from the left $\lim⁡_{x \to c−}f(x)$ or from the right $\lim⁡_{x \to c+}f(x)$.

#### Examples

1. **Limit of a Constant Function**: $lim⁡_{x→a}c=c$
2. **Limit of xx as xx approaches aa**: $lim⁡_{x→a}x=a$
#### Applications

- **Calculus**: Limits are used to define derivatives and integrals.
- **Optimization Problems**: Limits help in finding maximum and minimum values of functions.
- **Engineering**: Used in control theory and systems modeling.
