In mathematics, continuity is a fundamental concept that describes the behavior of functions in a smooth or unbroken manner. A continuous function is one where small changes in the input result in small changes in the output, without any abrupt jumps or discontinuities.

#### Definition

A function f(x) is said to be continuous at a point x=a if the limit of f(x) as x approaches aa exists and is equal to f(a). Formally, this is expressed as:

$$\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$$

#### Properties

- **Uniform Continuity**: A stronger form of continuity where the function behaves uniformly across its domain.
- **Pointwise Continuity**: The function is continuous at every point in its domain.
- **Interval Continuity**: The function is continuous over an interval if it is continuous at every point within that interval.

#### Examples

1. **Polynomial Functions**: All polynomial functions are continuous everywhere.
2. **Trigonometric Functions**: Functions like $\sin⁡(x)$ and $\cos⁡(x)$ are continuous everywhere.

#### Applications

- **Calculus**: Fundamental to the study of limits, derivatives, and integrals.
- **Engineering**: Used in control systems and optimization.
- **Physics**: Describes smooth transitions in physical systems.
