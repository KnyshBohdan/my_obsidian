Derivatives are a cornerstone of calculus, providing the means to describe rates of change and the behavior of functions. They are used extensively in various fields such as physics, economics, and engineering to model dynamic systems.

#### Definition

The derivative of a function f(x) at a point x=a is defined as the limit:

$$f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0 }\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}$$

provided this limit exists. For a function f(x), its derivative f′(x) gives a new function that represents the rate of change of f(x) with respect to x.

#### Examples

1. **Linear Function**: For f(x)=mx+b, f′(x)=m
2. **Quadratic Function**: For f(x)=x2, f′(x)=2x (using the Power Rule)

#### Properties

- **Linearity**: (af(x)+bg(x))′=af′(x)+bg′(x)
- **Product Rule**: (f(x)g(x))′=f′(x)g(x)+f(x)g′(x)
- **Chain Rule**: (f(g(x)))′=f′(g(x))⋅g′(x)

#### Applications

- **Physics**: Used to describe motion, forces, and energy.
- **Economics**: Used in marginal cost and marginal revenue calculations.
- **Machine Learning**: Used in optimization algorithms like gradient descent.
