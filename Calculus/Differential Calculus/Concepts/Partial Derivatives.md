Partial derivatives are a cornerstone in multivariable calculus, allowing us to understand how a function changes with respect to one variable while keeping others constant. They are essential tools in fields like physics, engineering, and economics for optimizing systems with multiple variables.

## Definition

A partial derivative of a function f(x,y,…) with respect to a variable xx is denoted by $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$. It is defined as the limit:

$$\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a_1,..., a_{i - 1}, a_i + h, a_{i + 1}, ..., a_n) - f(a_1, ..., a_i, ..., a_n)}{h}$$

## Notation

The partial derivative can be variously denoted by fx​, fx′f​, ∂xf, Dxf D1f, ∂∂xf, or  $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$

## Properties

- **Directional Derivative**: The directional derivative ∇vf can be defined in terms of partial derivatives.
    
- **Mixed Partial Derivatives**: If the function is sufficiently smooth, the order of taking partial derivatives can be interchanged, known as Clairaut's theorem.
    

## Applications

- **Physics**: Used in equations of motion and field theory.
    
- **Engineering**: Employed in optimization problems.
    
- **Economics**: Utilized in utility and cost functions.
