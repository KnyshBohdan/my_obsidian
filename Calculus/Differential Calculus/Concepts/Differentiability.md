Differentiability is a central concept in calculus that deals with the ability of a function to be locally approximated by a linear function. In simpler terms, a function is differentiable if it has a "smooth" graph, without any sharp turns, angles, or cusps.

#### Definition

A function f(x) is said to be differentiable at a point x=a if its derivative f′(a) exists at that point. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

$$f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}$$

#### Properties

- **Continuity**: A differentiable function is necessarily continuous at every point where it is differentiable.
- **Higher-Order Differentiability**: A function is said to be of class Ck if its first k derivatives exist and are continuous over the domain of the function.

#### Examples

1. **Polynomial Functions**: These are differentiable everywhere.
2. **Trigonometric Functions**: Functions like sin⁡(x) and cos⁡(x) are differentiable everywhere.

#### Applications

- **Physics**: Used in motion equations and optimization problems.
- **Engineering**: Essential for control systems and signal processing.
- **Machine Learning**: Gradient descent algorithms rely on differentiability.
