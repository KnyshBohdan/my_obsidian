L'Hôpital's Rule is a powerful mathematical theorem used for evaluating limits of indeterminate forms. Developed in the 17th century, it employs derivatives to transform complex limit problems into simpler forms that can be easily solved. The rule is particularly useful in calculus and mathematical analysis.

#### Definition:

L'Hôpital's Rule states that for functions f(x) and g(x) which are differentiable on an open interval II except possibly at a point cc contained in II, if

$\lim_{x \to c}f(x)=\lim_{x \to c}g(x)=0$ or ±∞

and g′(x)≠0 for all x in I with x≠c, and

$\lim_{x \to c}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$

exists, then

$$\lim_{x \to c}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\lim_{x \to c}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$$

#### Connections:

1. [**Calculus**]: L'Hôpital's Rule is a fundamental theorem in calculus, often used to evaluate limits that appear in differentiation and integration.
2. **[Mathematical Analysis**]: The rule is a key tool in real analysis, particularly in the study of functions and their behavior near singular points.
3. [**Differentiability**]: The rule requires the functions f(x) and g(x) to be differentiable, linking it to the broader concept of differentiability in calculus.
