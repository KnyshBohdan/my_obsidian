Differential calculus is a subfield of calculus concerned with the study of rates at which quantities change. It is the mathematical foundation for understanding how things vary and has applications in virtually every field of science and engineering. The central concept is the derivative, which represents an infinitesimal rate of change.

#### Definition

The derivative of a function f(x) at a point x=a is defined as the limit:

$$f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}$$

provided this limit exists. For a function f(x) defined over some domain, its derivative f′(x) is a new function that gives the rate of change of f(x) at each point xx in its domain.

#### Examples

1. **Power Rule**: The derivative of $x^n$ is $nx^{n−1}$.
2. **Product Rule**: $(fg)'=f'g+fg'$

#### Properties

- **Linearity**: The derivative operator is linear, i.e., $(af + bg)' = af' + bg'$.
- **Chain Rule**: $(f(g(x)))'=f'(g(x))g'(x)$.

#### Applications

- **Physics**: Used in motion, energy, and wave equations.
- **Economics**: Helps in finding marginal cost and marginal revenue.
- **Biology**: Models population dynamics.
- **Engineering**: Used in optimization problems.

#### Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Integral Calculus]]**: The antithesis of differential calculus, focuses on accumulation of quantities.
- **[[Limits]]**: The derivative is defined using limits.
- **[[Continuous Functions]]**: Differentiability often requires the function to be continuous.
- **[[Optimization]]**: Critical points, found through derivatives, are used in optimization problems.
- **[[Taylor Series]]**: Derivatives are used to expand functions into their Taylor series.
