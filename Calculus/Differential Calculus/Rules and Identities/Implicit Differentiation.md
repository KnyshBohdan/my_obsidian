Implicit Differentiation is a technique in calculus used to find derivatives of equations that are not easily expressed as functions. In other words, it's a method used when it is challenging to isolate the dependent variable on one side of the equation. This technique is particularly useful in physics, engineering, and economics where such equations frequently occur.

#### Definition

Given an equation involving both xx and y, say F(x,y)=0, the derivative of y with respect to xx can be found by differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to xx, treating y as an implicit function of xx. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

$$\frac{d}{dx}[F(x, y)] = \frac{d}{dx}[0]$$

This results in an equation involving dydx​, which can then be solved to find dydx​.

#### Examples

1. **Circle Equation**: Given $x^2+y^2=1$, implicit differentiation yields 2x+2y$\frac{dy}{dx}$=0, and $\frac{dy}{dx}=−\frac{x}{y}$.
    
2. **Ellipse Equation**: For $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2}=1$, implicit differentiation provides $\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{b^2 x}{a^2 y}$​.
    

#### Applications

- **Physics**: Used in equations describing curves and surfaces in space.
- **Engineering**: Useful in systems where explicit functions are hard to obtain.
- **Economics**: Employed in utility maximization and cost minimization problems.
