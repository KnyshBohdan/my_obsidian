The Quotient Rule is an indispensable tool in calculus for finding the derivative of a quotient of two functions. It is particularly useful when you want to determine how the ratio of two functions changes with respect to the independent variable.

#### Definition

In calculus, the Quotient Rule states that if u(x) and v(x) are two differentiable functions and v(x)≠0, then the derivative of their quotient u(x) is given by:

$$(\frac{u}{v})' = \frac{u' \times v - u \times v'}{v^2}$$

Here, u′ and v′ are the derivatives of uu and vv respectively.

#### Examples

1. **Derivative of x2x+1x+1x2​**: Using the Quotient Rule, the derivative would be (2x)(x+1)−(x2)(1)(x+1)2(x+1)2(2x)(x+1)−(x2)(1)​.

#### Connections

1. **Chain Rule**: The Quotient Rule is often used in conjunction with the Chain Rule for composite functions.
2. **Implicit Differentiation**: The Quotient Rule is frequently employed in implicit differentiation, especially when the equation involves division of variables.
3. **Higher-Order Derivatives**: The Quotient Rule can be extended to find higher-order derivatives of a quotient of functions.
4. **Integration by Parts**: This integration technique can be viewed as the counterpart of the Quotient Rule in the realm of integration.
