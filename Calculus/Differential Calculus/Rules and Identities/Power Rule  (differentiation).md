The Power Rule is a fundamental concept in calculus that simplifies the process of differentiating functions of the form f(x)=xr where rr is a real number. This rule is particularly useful for polynomials and forms the basis for Taylor series.

#### Definition

The Power Rule states that if f(x)=xrf(x)=xr, where rr is a real number, then the derivative f′(x)f′(x) is given by:

f′(x)=r×xr−1f′(x)=r×xr−1

#### Examples

1. **Differentiating x2**: Using the Power Rule, f′(x)=2x2−1=2x
2. **Differentiating x−1** Here, f′(x)=−1×x−1−1=−x−2

#### Applications

- **Optimization Problems**: The Power Rule is often used in optimization problems to find local minima or maxima.
- **Physics**: In kinematics, the Power Rule helps in finding velocity and acceleration given the position function.
- **Engineering**: Used in various engineering fields for modeling and simulations.
