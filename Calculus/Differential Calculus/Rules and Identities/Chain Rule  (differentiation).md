The Chain Rule is a powerful tool in calculus for differentiating composite functions. It allows you to break down complex functions into simpler parts, making the differentiation process more manageable. This rule is particularly useful when dealing with functions that are compositions of other functions.

#### Definition

Suppose f(x) and g(x) are functions, and f(g(x)) is their composite function. The Chain Rule states that the derivative of f(g(x)) with respect to x is given by:

$$\frac{d(f(g(x)))}{dx} = f'(g(x)) g'(x)$$

Here, f′(g(x)) is the derivative of ff with respect to g(x), and g′(x) is the derivative of gg with respect to xx.

#### Examples

1. **Differentiating sin⁡(x2)**
    
    $\frac{d(sin(x^2))}{dx} = \cos(x^2) 2x$
    


#### Applications

- **Physics**: Used in kinematics to find velocity and acceleration.
- **Engineering**: Essential in control theory and systems modeling.
- **Economics**: Used in marginal cost and marginal revenue calculations.
