The Product Rule is a fundamental concept in calculus that provides a formula for finding the derivative of the product of two functions. This rule is particularly useful when you have two functions multiplied together and you want to find the rate at which their product is changing.

#### Definition

In calculus, the Product Rule states that if u(x) and v(x) are two differentiable functions, then the derivative of their product u(x)×v(x) is given by:

(u×v)′=u′×v+u×v′

Here, u′ and v′ are the derivatives of u and v respectively.

#### Connections

1. **Chain Rule**: The Product Rule often works in tandem with the Chain Rule when dealing with composite functions.
2. **Integration by Parts**: This rule is essentially the "reverse" of the Product Rule and is used in integration.
3. **Implicit Differentiation**: When dealing with equations involving products of variables, the Product Rule is often used in implicit differentiation.
4. **Higher-Order Derivatives**: The Product Rule can be generalized to higher-order derivatives through the General Leibniz rule.
