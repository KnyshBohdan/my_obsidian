Numerical differentiation and integration are techniques in numerical analysis that approximate the derivatives and integrals of functions. These methods are essential when analytical solutions are difficult or impossible to obtain, and they find applications in various fields such as physics, engineering, and computer science.

#### Definition:

- **Numerical Differentiation**: Algorithms estimate the derivative of a mathematical function using values of the function and perhaps other knowledge about the function. One common method is the finite difference approximation, which can be expressed as:

$$f′(x)≈\frac{f(x+h)−f(x)}{h}$$

- **Numerical Integration**: While the article did not provide information on numerical integration, it generally involves approximating the area under the curve of a function using methods like trapezoidal or Simpson's rule.

#### Explanation:

- **Numerical Differentiation**: The simplest method is to use finite difference approximations. The slope of a nearby secant line through points (x,f(x)) and (x+h,f(x+h)) is used to approximate the derivative. The error in this approximation is proportional to hh and can be reduced by choosing a smaller hh.
- **Numerical Integration**: Methods like trapezoidal and Simpson's rule approximate the integral by breaking the area under the curve into smaller, easier-to-calculate shapes like trapezoids or parabolas.

#### Examples:

- **Central Difference**: $f′(x)≈\frac{f(x+h)−f(x−h)}{2h}$
- **Trapezoidal Rule**: $\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx \approx \frac{h}{2}[f(a) + f(b) + 2 \sum_{i = 1}^{n -1} f(a + ih)]$

#### Properties:

- **Step Size**: The choice of step size h is crucial for accuracy. Too small a step size can lead to rounding errors, while too large a step size can result in less accurate approximations.

#### Applications:

- **Physics**: In solving differential equations that describe physical systems.
- **Engineering**: In simulations and optimizations.
