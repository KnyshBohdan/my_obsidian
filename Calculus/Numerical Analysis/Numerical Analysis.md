Numerical analysis is the study of algorithms that use numerical approximation to solve problems in mathematical analysis. This field is crucial for approximating solutions to problems that cannot be solved analytically. It finds applications in various domains including engineering, physical sciences, life sciences, and even social sciences.

#### Definition:

In mathematical terms, numerical analysis focuses on the development and analysis of algorithms for approximating solutions to mathematical problems. It can be formally defined as:

Numerical Analysis=Study of Algorithms(Numerical Approximation)

where the algorithms aim to find approximate solutions to problems in mathematical analysis.

#### Explanation:

Imagine you are trying to predict the weather. The equations governing weather patterns are incredibly complex and cannot be solved exactly. Numerical analysis provides methods to approximate these solutions, giving us reasonably accurate weather forecasts. It's like using a net to catch fish in a vast ocean; you may not capture every single fish, but you get a good enough catch to understand what's in the water.

#### Examples:

1. **Solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)**:

$$\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y)$$

2. **Numerical Linear Algebra**:

Ax=b

where A is a matrix and x,b are vectors. 3. **Optimization Problems**:

Minimize f(x) subject to g(x)≤0

#### Properties:

- **Convergence**: The algorithm should converge to the actual solution.
- **Stability**: Small changes in input should result in small changes in output.
- **Efficiency**: The algorithm should be computationally efficient.

#### Applications:

- **Weather Prediction**: Uses advanced numerical methods for simulations.
- **Finance**: Hedge funds use numerical analysis for stock valuation.
- **Engineering**: Used in simulations for testing the structural integrity of buildings.
