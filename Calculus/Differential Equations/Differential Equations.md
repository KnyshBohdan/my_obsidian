Differential equations are mathematical equations that involve unknown functions and their derivatives. These equations are ubiquitous in various fields such as engineering, physics, economics, and biology, as they often model how physical quantities change with respect to each other over time.

#### Definition

A differential equation is an equation that relates one or more unknown functions and their derivatives. Mathematically, it can be represented in various forms, depending on whether it involves ordinary derivatives or partial derivatives, and whether it is linear or nonlinear. The study of differential equations primarily focuses on finding their solutions and understanding the properties of these solutions.

#### Properties

- **Order**: The order of a differential equation is determined by the highest order of derivative present in the equation.
- **Linearity**: A differential equation is linear if it can be written as a linear combination of the unknown function and its derivatives.
- **Homogeneous vs Non-Homogeneous**: A differential equation is homogeneous if it can be written in a form that equates to zero; otherwise, it is non-homogeneous.

#### Examples

1. **Newton's Second Law**: F=ma can be formulated as a second-order ordinary differential equation to describe motion.
2. **Heat Equation**: Describes how heat diffuses over time and space.

#### Applications

- **Engineering**: Used in control theory, signal processing, and mechanical design.
- **Physics**: Essential in quantum mechanics, relativity, and electromagnetism.
- **Economics**: Used in modeling market dynamics and optimization problems.
