Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are a cornerstone of applied mathematics, offering a framework for modeling and understanding various phenomena in physics, engineering, and other scientific disciplines. Unlike ordinary differential equations, PDEs involve multiple variables and their partial derivatives, making them inherently more complex and versatile.

#### Definition

A Partial Differential Equation (PDE) is an equation that involves unknown multivariable functions and their partial derivatives. Mathematically, it can be represented as an equation involving partial derivatives of a function of multiple variables.

#### Characteristics

- **Types**: PDEs can be linear or nonlinear, and they can be classified into various types like elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic.
- **Existence and Uniqueness**: Theorems related to the existence and uniqueness of solutions are crucial in the study of PDEs.
- **Numerical Methods**: Due to the complexity of PDEs, numerical methods are often employed for approximating solutions.

#### Applications

- **Physics**: PDEs are foundational in understanding phenomena like heat diffusion, fluid dynamics, and general relativity.
- **Engineering**: Used in various engineering fields for modeling systems and processes.
- **Economics**: Used in modeling economic systems and market behavior.

#### Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Ordinary Differential Equations]]**: PDEs generalize ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
- **[[Calculus of Variations]]**: PDEs are closely related to the calculus of variations.
- **[[Numerical Methods]]**: Numerical methods are often used to solve PDEs that don't have an analytical solution.
- **[[Stochastic Processes]]**: Stochastic partial differential equations extend the concept of PDEs to include randomness.
