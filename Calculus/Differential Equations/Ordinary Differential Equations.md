Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) are equations that involve functions of only one independent variable and their derivatives. They are "ordinary" in the sense that they contain no partial derivatives, which distinguishes them from Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).

### Definition

An Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) is an equation of the form:

F(x,y,y′,y′′,…,y(n))=0

where F is a function of x, y, and its n derivatives y′,y′′,…,y(n). The highest order of the derivative, n, defines the order of the ODE.

### Types of ODEs

1. **Linear ODEs**: These are equations that can be written in the form a0(x)y+a1(x)y′+…+an(x)y(n)=b(x))
2. **Non-linear ODEs**: Equations that cannot be written in the linear form.

### Examples

1. **First-order Linear ODE**: y′+2xy=0
2. **Second-order Linear ODE**: y′′−4y′+4y=0
3. **Non-linear ODE**: y′′+y2=0

### Applications

- **Physics**: Describes motion, heat flow, wave equations, etc.
- **Engineering**: Used in control theory, signal processing, and mechanical simulations.
- **Economics**: Models like the Solow growth model and Black-Scholes equation.
- **Biology**: Population dynamics, neural networks, and the spread of diseases.
