Anomaly Detection is the process of identifying data points, events, or observations that significantly deviate from the expected pattern in a dataset. It is often used to identify abnormal behavior that may be indicative of critical incidents, such as fraud, network intrusion, or operational inefficiencies.

## Definition

Anomaly Detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of unexpected events, observations, or items that differ significantly from the norm. It is generally understood to be the identification of rare items, events, or observations which deviate significantly from the majority of the data.

## Types of Anomalies

1. **Point Anomalies**: Individual data points that deviate markedly from the rest of the data.
2. **Contextual Anomalies**: Anomalies that are context-specific, often temporal in nature.
3. **Collective Anomalies**: A collection of related data instances that are anomalous with respect to the entire dataset.

### Methods of Detection

- **Unsupervised**: Detects anomalies based solely on the intrinsic properties of the data.
- **Semi-supervised**: Uses a normal, labeled training dataset to construct a model representing normal behavior.
- **Supervised**: Requires a complete set of "normal" and "abnormal" labels for a classification algorithm to work with.

## Applications

- **Cybersecurity**: To detect network intrusions or vulnerabilities.
- **Finance**: For fraud detection and risk assessment.
- **Healthcare**: In the diagnosis of rare diseases or conditions.
- **Industrial Applications**: For quality control and fault detection.

## Challenges

- **False Positives**: Identifying actual anomalies rather than data noise is essential.
- **Scalability**: Handling large datasets can be computationally intensive.
