ARIMA is a statistical model used for analyzing and forecasting time series data. It combines autoregressive (AR), integrated (I), and moving average (MA) components to capture various aspects of the data.

## Definition

An ARIMA model is defined as ARIMA(p, d, q), where:

- p: The number of lag observations in the model (lag order).
- d: The number of times the raw observations are differenced (degree of differencing).
- q: The size of the moving average window (order of the moving average).

(1−∑i=1pϕiLi)(1−L)dXt=(1+∑i=1qθiLi)ϵt​

## Components

- **Autoregression (AR)**: The variable is regressed on its own lagged values.
- **Integrated (I)**: Differencing the observations to make the time series stationary.
- **Moving Average (MA)**: Dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.

### Types of ARIMA Models

- **Non-seasonal ARIMA**: Denoted as ARIMA(p, d, q).
- **Seasonal ARIMA**: Denoted as ARIMA(p, d, q)(P, D, Q)m, where mm refers to the number of periods in each season.

## Applications

- **Financial Markets**: To predict stock prices and market trends.
- **Economic Forecasting**: For predicting indicators like GDP.
- **Sales Forecasting**: In retail to predict future sales.

## Challenges

- **Data Stationarity**: The data must be made stationary for effective modeling.
- **Parameter Selection**: Choosing appropriate p,d,qp,d,q values can be challenging.
- **Computational Complexity**: Requires significant computational resources for large datasets.
