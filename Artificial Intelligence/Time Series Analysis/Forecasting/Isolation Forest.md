Isolation Forest is an unsupervised learning algorithm designed for anomaly detection. It was initially developed by Fei Tony Liu and Zhi-Hua Zhou in 2008. The algorithm employs a unique partitioning technique to isolate anomalies, making it efficient in terms of time complexity and memory usage.

## Definition

Isolation Forest is an ensemble learning method that utilizes multiple decision trees to isolate anomalies in a dataset. It operates under the premise that anomalies are data points that are "few and different," and thus easier to isolate.

Anomaly Score=f(Path Length,Tree Ensemble)

## Algorithmic Details

- **Isolation Trees (iTrees)**: The algorithm uses a forest of iTrees, each constructed by recursively partitioning the feature space.
- **Path Length**: The number of edges traversed from the root node to an external node in an iTree. Shorter paths are indicative of anomalies.
- **Anomaly Score**: Aggregated from the path lengths obtained from each iTree in the ensemble.

## Applications

- **Fraud Detection**: In banking and financial sectors.
- **Network Security**: For intrusion detection.
- **Healthcare**: In identifying rare diseases or conditions.

## Advantages and Limitations

- **Efficiency**: Linear time complexity and low memory requirements.
- **Unsupervised**: Does not require labeled data.
- **Limitations**: May not perform well on clustered anomalies.
