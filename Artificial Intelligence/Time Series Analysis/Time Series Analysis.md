Time Series Analysis is the study of data points collected or recorded at a regular time interval. It aims to understand underlying structures, patterns, and other characteristics in the observed data.

## Definition

Time Series Analysis is the methodical study of a sequence of data points collected over specific intervals of time. The analysis can reveal how variables change over time and provides an additional source of information, establishing a set of dependencies between the data points.

Yt=f(Xt−1,Xt−2,…)Yt​=f(Xt−1​,Xt−2​,…)

## Key Concepts

1. **Stationarity**: A time series is said to be stationary if its statistical properties do not change over time.
2. **Seasonality**: Regular variation in data that occurs at specific times within a given period.
3. **Trend**: The underlying pattern in the data over a long period.
4. **Noise**: Random variation in the data.

### Types of Time Series Analysis

- **Classification**: Assigns categories to the data.
- **Curve Fitting**: Plots the data along a curve to study variable relationships.
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Identifies patterns like trends, cycles, or seasonal variations.
- **Forecasting**: Predicts future data based on historical trends.

## Applications

- **Finance**: For stock market analysis and portfolio management.
- **Weather Forecasting**: To predict meteorological conditions.
- **Healthcare**: For monitoring heart rates and brain activity.
- **Retail**: To analyze sales data and customer behavior.

## Challenges

- **Data Quality**: Inconsistent or missing data can lead to inaccurate analyses.
- **Computational Complexity**: Some methods require significant computational power.

## Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Machine Learning]]**: Time series forecasting is often done using machine learning algorithms.
- **[[Statistics]]**: Statistical methods like ARIMA are commonly used in time series analysis.
