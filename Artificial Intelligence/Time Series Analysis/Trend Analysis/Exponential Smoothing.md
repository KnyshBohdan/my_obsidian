Exponential Smoothing is a time series forecasting method that uses an exponentially weighted average of past observations to predict future values. Unlike simple moving averages, where each observation is weighted equally, Exponential Smoothing assigns exponentially decreasing weights to observations as they age.

## Definition

The basic formula for Exponential Smoothing is:

$s_t=αx_t+(1−α)s_t−1$

Where $s_t$​ is the smoothed value at time t, $x_t​$ is the observed value at time tt, $s_{t−1}$ is the previous smoothed value, and α is the smoothing parameter between 0 and 1.

## Types of Exponential Smoothing

1. **Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES)**: Assumes no trend or seasonality in the time series.
2. **Holt's Linear Exponential Smoothing**: Used for time series data with a linear trend but no seasonal pattern.
3. **Holt-Winters' Exponential Smoothing**: Used for time series data with both a trend and a seasonal component.

## Applications

- **Financial Forecasting**: For predicting stock prices and market trends.
- **Inventory Management**: To forecast demand and manage stock levels.
- **Climate Modeling**: To smooth out temperature and weather data.

## Advantages and Limitations

- **Advantages**: Adapts to changing trends, less affected by noise.
- **Limitations**: Requires selection of smoothing parameter αα, not suitable for all types of data.
