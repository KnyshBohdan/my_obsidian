Moving Averages are a type of technical indicator used to smooth out price data and identify trends over a specific period. They are particularly useful in reducing the impact of random, short-term fluctuations in the price of a financial instrument.

## Definition

A Moving Average is calculated by summing up the data points of a financial security over a specific time period and dividing the total by the number of data points. It is a "lagging" indicator because it trails the price action of the underlying asset.

Moving Average=Sum of Data Points/Number of Time Periods

## Types of Moving Averages

1. **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: The SMA is calculated by summing up the recent data points in a given set and dividing the total by the number of time periods. It is backward-looking and relies on past price data.
    
    $$SMA = \frac{A_1 + A_2 + ... + A_n}{n}$$
    
2. **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**: The EMA gives more weight to the most recent price points, making it more responsive to recent changes.
    
    $$EMA_t = [V_t (\frac{s}{1 + d})] + EMA_y [1 - (\frac{s}{1 + d})]$$
