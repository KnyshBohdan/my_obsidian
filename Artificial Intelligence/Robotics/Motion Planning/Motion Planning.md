Motion Planning, also known as path planning, is a computational problem that aims to find a sequence of valid configurations to move an object from a source to a destination. This field is crucial in robotics, computer animation, and even video games.

## Definition

Motion Planning is the computational task of finding a sequence of valid configurations that moves an object from a source to a destination while avoiding obstacles and satisfying certain constraints.

Motion Planning=f(Source, Destination, Obstacles, Constraints)

## Types of Motion Planning

1. **Configuration Space Planning**: Deals with the high-dimensional space of all possible robot configurations.
2. **Grid-Based Planning**: Uses a grid overlay on top of the configuration space.
3. **Sampling-Based Planning**: Efficiently samples the configuration space to find a path.

## Main Concepts

- **Configuration Space**: The set of all possible configurations of the robot.
- **Free Space**: The set of configurations that avoids collision with obstacles.
- **Target Space**: A subspace of free space denoting the destination.
- **Obstacle Space**: The space that the robot cannot move to.

## Applications

- **Robotics**: For navigating robots in various environments.
- **Computer Animation**: For animating digital characters.
- **Video Games**: For character and object movement.
- **Robotic Surgery**: For precise movement of surgical instruments.

## Advantages and Limitations

- **Advantages**: Enables complex tasks, adaptable to different robots and environments.
- **Limitations**: Computationally intensive, may require high-quality models of the environment.
