Pathfinding Algorithms are computational procedures that find the shortest or most efficient path between two points. These algorithms are widely used in robotics, computer games, and map services to find the best route from a start to a destination point.

## Definition

Pathfinding is the plotting, by a computer application, of the shortest route between two points. It is a more practical variant of solving mazes and is heavily based on graph theory.

Pathfinding=f(Start Point, End Point, Obstacles, Graph)

## Common Algorithms

1. **A***: Combines the benefits of Dijkstra’s and Breadth-First-Search to find the shortest path efficiently.
2. **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: Used when finding the shortest path is more important than efficiency.
3. **Breadth-First-Search (BFS)**: Used when the path needs to be found quickly but doesn't have to be the shortest.

## How They Work

- **A***: Explores paths that are likely to be more promising first.
- **Dijkstra’s**: Expands the search area gradually until the shortest path is found.
- **BFS**: Expands the search area one level at a time until the goal is reached.

## Common Issues

- **Local Minima**: Algorithms can get stuck in suboptimal paths.
- **Cycles**: Revisiting the same nodes, wasting time and resources.
- **Combinatorial Explosion**: Failing to find any path due to the complexity of the search space.

## Applications

- **Robotics**: For navigating robots through complex terrains.
- **Game Development**: For character and object movement.
- **Map Services**: For route planning in GPS services.
