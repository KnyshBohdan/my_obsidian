Grasping techniques in robotics refer to the various methods employed by robotic manipulators to pick up, hold, and release objects. These techniques are crucial for tasks ranging from industrial automation to healthcare.

## Definition

Grasping in robotics is the act of seizing, holding, or otherwise manipulating an object using a robotic manipulator. The effectiveness of a grasp is often determined by factors such as the object's size, weight, and fragility, as well as the gripper's kinematics and torque.

## Types of Grasping Techniques

1. **1-DoF Scissor-Like Gripper**: A simple one degree-of-freedom claw, often used in prosthetics. It consists of an active finger that presses an object against a passive finger. This design relies heavily on friction.
    
2. **Parallel Jaw Gripper**: Common in industrial settings, it uses two parallel jaws to grasp an object. These jaws are usually driven by a single actuator.
    

## Key Concepts

- **Friction**: Essential for the effectiveness of the grasp.
- **Torque**: The force exerted by the gripper, crucial for holding objects securely.
- **Kinematics**: The study of the gripper's movement, important for grasp planning.

## Applications

- **Industrial Automation**: For picking and placing objects.
- **Healthcare**: Used in robotic surgery and prosthetics.
- **Consumer Electronics**: In devices like robotic vacuums.

## Challenges

- **Object Fragility**: The gripper must be able to handle fragile objects without damaging them.
- **Sensing**: Accurate sensing is required for effective grasping.
- **Control**: The gripper's movements must be precisely controlled.
