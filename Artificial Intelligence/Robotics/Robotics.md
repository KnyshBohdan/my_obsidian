Robotics is the interdisciplinary branch of engineering and science that involves the design, construction, operation, and application of robots. Robots are autonomous or semi-autonomous machines capable of performing tasks in the real world.

## Definition

Robotics is defined as the study of robots, which are automated machines that can assist humans in a variety of tasks. The field encompasses everything from robot design and fabrication to programming and artificial intelligence.

Robotics=Mechanical Engineering+Computer Science+Electrical Engineering

## Types of Robots

1. **Industrial Robots**: Used in manufacturing and production lines. Examples include the Unimate and PUMA.
2. **Mobile Robots**: Used in logistics and warehouse management. Examples include Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGVs).
3. **Dependent Robots**: Non-autonomous robots that interact with humans to enhance their actions. Examples include advanced prosthetics.

## Main Components

- **Control System**: The CPU that directs a robot's tasks.
- **Sensors**: Provide electrical signals to allow a robot to interact with the world.
- **Actuators**: Responsible for a robot's movement.
- **Power Supply**: The battery that supplies power to a robot.

## Applications

- **Manufacturing**: Assembly lines, welding, painting.
- **Healthcare**: Surgical robots, prosthetics.
- **Exploration**: Deep-sea, space exploration.

## Advantages and Limitations

- **Advantages**: Precision, repeatability, can work in hazardous environments.
- **Limitations**: High initial cost, require programming and maintenance.

## Connection to Other Topics
