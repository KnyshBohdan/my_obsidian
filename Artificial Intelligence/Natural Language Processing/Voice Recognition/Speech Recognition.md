Speech Recognition is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies to enable the automatic recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers. It is also known as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Computer Speech Recognition, or Speech-to-Text (STT).

## Definition

Speech Recognition involves the conversion of spoken language into a form that a computer can understand, typically text. The process includes several components such as speech input, feature extraction, feature vectors, a decoder, and a word output. The decoder uses acoustic models, a pronunciation dictionary, and language models to determine the appropriate output.

## How It Works

1. **Acoustic Models**: These models are used to match spoken phrases to phonemes or other acoustic units.
2. **Language Models**: These models predict the likelihood of a sequence of words, improving the system's accuracy.
3. **Decoder**: This component leverages acoustic and language models to convert speech into text.

### Key Concepts

- **Word Error Rate (WER)**: A measure of the system's accuracy.
- **Speaker-Dependent vs Speaker-Independent**: Systems may require training (speaker-dependent) or not (speaker-independent).
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Often used to improve the system's understanding of language.

## Applications

- **Voice User Interfaces**: For voice dialing, call routing, and appliance control.
- **Healthcare**: For transcribing medical records.
- **Customer Service**: Automated voice assistants for customer queries.

## Challenges

- **Background Noise**: Can affect recognition accuracy.
- **Accents and Dialects**: May require specialized models.
- **Computational Complexity**: Real-time recognition requires significant computational resources.

## Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Voice Recognition]]**: Focuses on identifying the speaker rather than what is being said.
- **[[Natural Language Processing]]**: Underpins the entire process by providing semantic understanding.
- **[[Machine Learning]]**: Various machine learning algorithms are used to improve accuracy.
