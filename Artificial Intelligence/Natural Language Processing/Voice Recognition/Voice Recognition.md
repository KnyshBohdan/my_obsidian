Voice Recognition, also known as speaker recognition, is a technology that converts spoken language into a form that a computer can understand and act upon. It is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and computational linguistics, and it incorporates knowledge from linguistics, computer engineering, and machine learning.

## Definition

Voice Recognition involves the automated conversion of analog audio into digital signals, which are then processed and interpreted by pattern recognition and voice recognition software. The technology can be categorized into two models: the hidden Markov model and neural networks.

## How It Works

1. **Analog-to-Digital Conversion**: Analog audio is converted into digital signals.
2. **Pattern Recognition**: A digital database of words or syllables is compared to the signals.
3. **Speech Models**: Hidden Markov models and neural networks are used to analyze speech.

### Key Concepts

- **Speaker-Dependent vs Speaker-Independent**: Systems that require training for a specific speaker are called "speaker-dependent," while those that do not are "speaker-independent."
- **Word Error Rate (WER)**: A measure of the system's accuracy.
- **Processing Speed**: Critical for real-time applications.

## Applications

- **Voice User Interfaces**: Such as voice dialing and call routing.
- **Home Automation**: Devices like Google Home and Amazon Echo.
- **Security**: For authentication or verification of a speaker's identity.

## Challenges

- **Background Noise**: Audio must be processed for clarity.
- **Accents and Dialects**: Can affect recognition accuracy.
- **Computational Cost**: Especially for large vocabularies.

## Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Natural Language Processing]]**: Voice Recognition is a subset of NLP.
- **[[Artificial Intelligence]]**: Machine learning techniques are often used.
- **[[Speech Recognition]]**: Focuses more on what is being said rather than who is speaking.
