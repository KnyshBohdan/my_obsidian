Semantics is the study of meaning in language and computation. It is a subfield that spans across disciplines like linguistics, philosophy, and computer science. Semantics aims to understand how meaning is constructed, interpreted, and communicated.

## Definition

Semantics is the study of reference, meaning, or truth. It can refer to subfields of several distinct disciplines, including philosophy, linguistics, and computer science. In linguistics, semantics focuses on the meaning of words, phrases, sentences, and larger units of discourse.

## Types of Semantics

1. **Linguistic Semantics**: Concerned with how languages organize and express meanings.
2. **Computational Semantics**: Focuses on the computational aspects of meaning in natural language.
3. **Lexical Semantics**: Studies the meaning of individual words.
4. **Phrasal Semantics**: Studies the principles governing the construction of phrase and sentence meaning.

### Key Concepts

- **Compositional Semantics**: How smaller parts like words combine to form the meaning of larger expressions.
- **Context**: The role of context in interpretation.
- **Ambiguity**: Words or phrases that have multiple meanings.
- **Entailment and Presuppositions**: Logical relations between sentences or propositions.

## Applications

- **Natural Language Processing**: For tasks like sentiment analysis and machine translation.
- **Semantic Web**: For better data interoperability.
- **Information Retrieval**: In search engines to improve query results.

## Challenges

- **Vagueness**: The imprecise or unclear meaning of words or phrases.
- **Idiomatic Expressions**: Phrases whose meanings cannot be inferred from the meanings of individual words.
- **Cultural Context**: The influence of culture on meaning.

## Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Natural Language Processing]]**: Semantics is a crucial component in NLP tasks.
- **[[Machine Learning]]**: Semantic analysis is often required for text-based machine learning models.
- **[[Artificial Intelligence]]**: Semantics is integral to understanding and generating human-like responses in AI systems.
