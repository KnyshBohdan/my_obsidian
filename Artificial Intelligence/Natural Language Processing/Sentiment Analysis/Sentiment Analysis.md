Sentiment Analysis, also known as opinion mining or emotion AI, is the computational study of people's opinions, sentiments, attitudes, and emotions expressed in written or spoken language. It employs techniques from natural language processing, text analysis, and computational linguistics to systematically identify, extract, and quantify affective states and subjective information.

## Definition

Sentiment Analysis aims to determine the attitude of a speaker or writer with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity of a document. It can be applied at various levels: document, sentence, or feature/aspect level.

## Types of Sentiment Analysis

1. **Polarity-based**: Classifies the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.
2. **Emotion-based**: Goes beyond polarity to identify specific emotional states like happiness, anger, or sadness.
3. **Aspect-based**: Focuses on specific aspects or features of a product or service.

### Key Concepts

- **Negation Handling**: Understanding the role of negations like "not" in the sentiment.
- **Sarcasm Detection**: Identifying when positive or negative words are used sarcastically.
- **Intensity Measurement**: Quantifying the strength of the sentiment.

## Applications

- **Customer Feedback**: To gauge customer satisfaction and improve products/services.
- **Market Research**: To understand market sentiment towards a brand or product.
- **Healthcare**: To analyze patient feedback and improve healthcare services.

## Challenges

- **Context Sensitivity**: Words can have different sentiments in different contexts.
- **Language and Cultural Nuances**: Sentiments can be expressed differently in different languages or cultures.
- **Ambiguity**: Handling ambiguous statements that may have more than one sentiment.
