Case-Based Reasoning is an AI methodology that solves new problems by adapting solutions from similar, previously solved problems. It is an experience-based approach that relies on a database of past cases to make decisions or predictions.

## Definition

Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is an approach in artificial intelligence that solves new problems by adapting solutions from similar past cases. It operates on the premise that similar problems have similar solutions.

## How It Works

CBR involves a four-step process:

1. **Retrieve**: Given a target problem, retrieve relevant cases from memory.
2. **Reuse**: Adapt the solution from the retrieved case to the new problem.
3. **Revise**: Test the adapted solution and make necessary revisions.
4. **Retain**: Store the new solution as a case for future reference.

## Historical Context

CBR has its roots in the work of AI theorist Roger Schank and his students at Yale in the late 20th century. They studied human problem-solving abilities and found that humans often rely on past experiences to solve new problems.

## Applications

- **Medical Diagnosis**: Adapting treatments based on similar patient histories.
- **Legal Systems**: Using legal precedents to argue cases.
- **Machine Learning**: As a learning algorithm that adapts over time.

## Advantages and Limitations

- **Adaptive Learning**: CBR systems can "learn" by acquiring new cases.
- **Domain Flexibility**: Applicable in various fields like medicine, law, and machine learning.
- **Data Dependency**: The quality of solutions depends on the quality and quantity of stored cases.

## Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Artificial Intelligence]]**: CBR is a subset of AI focusing on experience-based problem-solving.
- **[[Expert Systems]]**: While Expert Systems rely on predefined rules, CBR relies on past cases.
- **[[Machine Learning]]**: CBR can be seen as a type of machine learning that learns from past cases.
