Rule-Based Systems are a type of artificial intelligence system that make decisions or perform actions based on a set of predefined rules. These systems are designed to emulate human decision-making within specific domains.

## Definition

A Rule-Based System is an AI system that uses a predefined set of rules to make decisions or perform actions. These rules are often human-crafted and can be based on expert knowledge, data patterns, or heuristics.

## How It Works

A typical Rule-Based System consists of the following components:

1. **Rule Base**: A list of rules that define the system's behavior.
2. **Inference Engine**: Applies the rules to the given input to produce output.
3. **Working Memory**: Stores temporary data for rule evaluation.
4. **User Interface**: Allows interaction with the system.

### Rule Execution Cycle

1. **Match**: The left-hand sides of all rules are matched against the contents of working memory.
2. **Conflict-Resolution**: One of the matched rules is selected for execution.
3. **Act**: The actions specified in the selected rule are executed.

## Applications

- **Medical Diagnosis**: For identifying diseases based on symptoms.
- **Financial Fraud Detection**: For identifying irregularities in financial transactions.
- **Natural Language Processing**: For lexical analysis and interpretation.

## Advantages and Limitations

- **Transparency**: Rule-Based Systems are easily understood and explained.
- **Flexibility**: Rules can be easily added or modified.
- **Inflexibility**: May not adapt well to changing conditions.
- **Performance**: Can be slow as all rules must be checked before making a decision.

## Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Artificial Intelligence]]**: Rule-Based Systems are a subset of AI.
- **[[Expert Systems]]**: Often use Rule-Based Systems for decision-making.
- **[[Machine Learning]]**: Rule-Based Systems are different from learning algorithms but can be used in conjunction.
