Expert Systems are specialized computer programs designed to emulate the decision-making abilities of human experts within a particular domain. They are a form of artificial intelligence that applies predefined rules to analyze information and generate conclusions.

## Definition

An Expert System is an artificial intelligence system that performs tasks requiring human expertise by applying a set of rules to a knowledge base. It consists of two main components: the knowledge base, which stores facts and rules, and the inference engine, which applies these rules to deduce new facts or conclusions.

## How It Works

1. **Knowledge Base**: Accumulates facts and rules from domain experts.
2. **Inference Engine**: Applies rules to known facts to deduce new facts or conclusions.
3. **User Interface**: Allows users to interact with the system, often through a natural language interface.

### Types of Inference

- **Forward Chaining**: Processes a set of facts to make logical predictions.
- **Backward Chaining**: Processes a set of facts to reach a logical conclusion.

## Historical Context

Expert Systems were among the first truly successful forms of AI, developed in the 1970s and proliferating in the 1980s. They were formally introduced around 1965 by the Stanford Heuristic Programming Project led by Edward Feigenbaum, sometimes termed the "father of expert systems."

## Applications

- **Medical Diagnosis**: For diagnosing diseases based on symptoms.
- **Financial Investing**: For making investment decisions.
- **Petroleum Engineering**: For drilling and exploration activities.

## Advantages and Limitations

- **Efficiency**: Can solve complex problems efficiently.
- **Scalability**: Can be updated with new rules and facts.
- **Lack of Common Sense**: Cannot handle situations that are outside its knowledge base.
