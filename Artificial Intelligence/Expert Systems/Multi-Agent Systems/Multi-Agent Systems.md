Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are computerized systems composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents. These systems can solve problems that are difficult or impossible for an individual agent or a monolithic system to solve.

## Definition

A Multi-Agent System is a system where multiple agents interact with each other to achieve either a common or individual goals. These agents can be software entities, robots, or even human teams. The system does not have an explicit overall goal; instead, this is defined through the combination of multiple autonomous agents each with a specific local goal.

## Characteristics

- **Autonomy**: Agents are at least partially independent and self-aware.
- **Local Views**: No agent has a full global view of the system.
- **Decentralization**: No agent is designated as controlling the system.
- **Self-Organisation**: The system can manifest complex behaviors even when individual strategies are simple.

## Types of Agents

- **Passive Agents**: Agents without goals, such as obstacles in a simulation.
- **Active Agents**: Agents with simple goals, like birds in flocking.
- **Cognitive Agents**: Agents capable of complex calculations.

## Applications

- **Online Trading**: For automated buying and selling.
- **Disaster Response**: For coordinating rescue efforts.
- **Social Structure Modeling**: For understanding societal behaviors.

## Advantages and Limitations

- **Scalability**: Can be easily scaled to include more agents.
- **Flexibility**: Can adapt to changing conditions.
- **Complexity**: Managing interactions can be complex.
