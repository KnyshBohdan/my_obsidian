## Key Concepts

### Types of AI

1. **Narrow AI**: Specialized in one task. E.g., image recognition.
2. **General AI**: Intelligence comparable to human capabilities.
3. **Artificial Superintelligence**: Surpassing human intelligence.

### Trustworthy AI

AI systems must be:

- Valid and reliable
- Safe and secure
- Accountable and transparent
- Explainable and interpretable

## Examples

1. **Autonomous Vehicles**: Use AI for navigation and decision-making.
2. **Natural Language Processing**: Chatbots and translation services.
3. **Healthcare**: AI in diagnostics and treatment planning.

## Applications

- **Commerce**: Personalized recommendations.
- **Healthcare**: Predictive analytics for patient care.
- **Cybersecurity**: Anomaly detection in network traffic.
