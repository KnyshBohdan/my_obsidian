Unsupervised Learning is a type of machine learning that involves finding patterns in data that has not been labeled, categorized, or identified. Unlike supervised learning, it doesn't require a labeled output to learn, making it suitable for discovering hidden patterns in data.

## Definition

Unsupervised Learning is a machine learning paradigm where the algorithm is provided with input data that doesn't have labeled responses. The system tries to learn the patterns and the structure from the data without any supervision.

## Types of Unsupervised Learning

1. **Clustering**: Grouping of unlabeled data based on similarities or differences. Examples include K-means, hierarchical, and probabilistic clustering.
2. **Association**: Rule-based methods for finding interesting relationships between variables in large databases.
3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are used to reduce the number of variables in a dataset while preserving its structure.

### Measures of Similarity

- **Euclidean Distance**: Commonly used for points in a plane.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Often used in text analysis.
- **Jaccard Index**: Used for comparing the similarity of sets.

## Applications

- **Market Segmentation**: Identifying customer segments in marketing.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying fraudulent activities in transactions.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Topic modeling in text data.

## Challenges

- **Scalability**: Handling large datasets can be computationally intensive.
- **Interpreting Results**: The results are not always intuitive and may require domain expertise for interpretation.
