Semi-supervised Learning is a machine learning paradigm that combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data during training. It aims to make effective use of both types of data to improve model performance.

## Definition

Semi-supervised Learning involves training a model on a dataset that contains both labeled and unlabeled examples. The primary objective is to improve the learning accuracy of the model by utilizing the unlabeled data to provide additional context.

## Types of Semi-supervised Learning

1. **Self-training**: The model is initially trained with the labeled data and then uses this initial model to label the unlabeled data.
2. **Multi-view Training**: Different views of the data are used to train multiple models, which are then combined.
3. **Co-training**: Two classifiers are trained separately and their predictions are used to label the unlabeled data.

## Key Concepts

- **Label Propagation**: Spreading the labels of the labeled examples to the unlabeled examples.
- **Transductive Learning**: The goal is to label the given unlabeled data.
- **Inductive Learning**: The goal is to build a model that can generalize to new, unseen data.

## Applications

- **Natural Language Processing**: For tasks like sentiment analysis and named entity recognition.
- **Computer Vision**: For image classification and object detection.
- **Bioinformatics**: For gene expression classification.

## Challenges

- **Data Quality**: The quality of the unlabeled data can significantly impact the performance.
- **Computational Complexity**: The algorithms can be computationally intensive.
