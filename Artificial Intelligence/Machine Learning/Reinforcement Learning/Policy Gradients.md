Policy Gradients are a family of algorithms in Reinforcement Learning that directly optimize the policy function, which specifies the probability distribution over actions given a state. Unlike value-based methods like Q-Learning, Policy Gradients aim to find the optimal policy without requiring a value function.

## Definition

Policy Gradients focus on optimizing a policy ππ that maximizes the expected return by adjusting the policy parameters θ. The policy πθ(a∣s) is a probability distribution over actions aa given a state ss.

## Algorithm

The core idea is to adjust the policy parameters θ in the direction that increases the expected return. The objective function J(θ) is defined as:

$J(θ)=E_{τ∼πθ}[R(τ)]$

Where ττ is a trajectory and R(τ) is the total reward for that trajectory. The policy parameters are updated using gradient ascent:

$θ←θ+α∇θJ(θ)$

## Applications

- **Robotics**: For tasks like navigation and manipulation.
- **Natural Language Processing**: For sequence-to-sequence tasks.
- **Game Playing**: For developing strategies in complex games.

## Key Concepts

- **Exploration-Exploitation**: Balancing the need to try new actions and stick with known, rewarding actions.
- **Reward Shaping**: The process of defining the right set of rewards for a given problem.

## Challenges

- **High Variance**: Policy Gradients often suffer from high variance in the updates.
- **Sample Efficiency**: They often require a large number of samples, making them computationally expensive.
