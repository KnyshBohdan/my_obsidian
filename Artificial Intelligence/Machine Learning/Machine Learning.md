Machine Learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. This learning process is based on the recognition of complex patterns in data and the making of intelligent decisions based on them.

## Definition

Machine Learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows a system to learn from data rather than through explicit programming. In other words, ML is an application of AI that provides the system the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience.

## Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**: The model is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label.
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: The model is trained on an unlabeled dataset and must infer the natural structure present within the data.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns to perform a task by receiving rewards for beneficial actions.

## Key Concepts

- **Features**: The input variables used for making predictions.
- **Target Variable**: The variable that the model aims to predict.
- **Training Set**: The dataset used to train the model.
- **Test Set**: The dataset used to evaluate the model.

## Applications

- **Natural Language Processing**: For tasks like translation, and sentiment analysis.
- **Computer Vision**: For tasks like image recognition, and object detection.
- **Healthcare**: For diagnosing diseases and predicting patient outcomes.

## Ethical Considerations

- **Bias and Discrimination**: ML models can inherit biases present in data or introduced by algorithmic processes.
- **Data Privacy**: Concerns about how data is collected and used for training models.

## Advantages and Limitations

- **Adaptability**: Can learn and improve from data.
- **Complexity**: Capable of handling large-scale, high-dimensional data.
- **Data Dependence**: Quality of the model is dependent on the quality of the data used.

## Connection to Other Topics
