Classification is a type of supervised learning algorithm that aims to categorize data points into predefined classes or labels. The algorithm learns from labeled training data and makes predictions based on that knowledge.

## Definition

Classification in machine learning involves predicting the class label of a given data point. The classes can be binary, such as "spam" or "not spam," or they can be multiple classes like "red," "green," or "blue."

## Types of Classification

1. **Binary Classification**: Deals with two possible outcomes. For example, "yes" or "no," "true" or "false," "spam" or "not spam."
2. **Multi-Class Classification**: Deals with more than two outcomes, where each outcome is assigned to only one label.
3. **Multi-Label Classification**: May have more than one class label assigned to the data.

### Lazy Learners vs. Eager Learners

- **Lazy Learners**: Store the training data and wait until testing data appears. Classification is conducted based on the most related stored training data. Example: K-nearest neighbor.
- **Eager Learners**: Construct a classification model based on the given training data before receiving data for classification. Example: Decision Trees, Naive Bayes.

## Key Algorithms

- **Decision Trees**: Utilizes an "if-then" rule set for classification.
- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier inspired by Bayes' theorem.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Classifies a data point based on how its neighbors are classified.
- **Artificial Neural Networks**: Used for complex tasks like image and speech recognition.

## Applications

- **Spam Filtering**: Classifying emails as spam or not spam.
- **Medical Diagnosis**: Classifying diseases based on symptoms.
- **Financial Forecasting**: Classifying credit risk levels.

## Challenges

- **Overfitting**: The model learns the training data too well, failing to generalize to new data.
- **Data Imbalance**: Unequal representation of classes in the training data.
