Supervised Learning is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained on a labeled dataset. The model makes predictions or decisions based on input data and is corrected when its predictions are incorrect.

## Definition

Supervised Learning involves training a model on a dataset that includes both the input variables and the desired output variable, which is often called the label. The model learns to map the input to the output based on the training data, and its performance is evaluated using a separate test set.

## Types of Supervised Learning

1. **Classification**: The task of categorizing input data into predefined classes. Algorithms include Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).
2. **Regression**: The task of predicting a continuous output variable. Algorithms include Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Logistic Regression.

## Key Algorithms

- **Neural Networks**: Used for complex tasks like image and speech recognition.
- **Naive Bayes**: Primarily used in text classification and spam identification.
- **Linear Regression**: Used to identify relationships between variables.
- **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification problems.

## Applications

- **Natural Language Processing**: For tasks like sentiment analysis and machine translation.
- **Computer Vision**: For image classification, object detection, and facial recognition.
- **Healthcare**: For diagnosing diseases and predicting patient outcomes.

## Challenges

- **Overfitting**: The model learns the training data too well, failing to generalize to new data.
- **Data Imbalance**: The classes in the training data are not equally represented, leading to biased models.
