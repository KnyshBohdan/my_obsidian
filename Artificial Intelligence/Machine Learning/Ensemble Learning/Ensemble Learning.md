Ensemble Learning is a meta-approach in machine learning that aims to improve predictive performance by combining the outputs of multiple models. It leverages the strengths of each individual model to produce a more robust and accurate composite model.

## Definition

Ensemble Learning is a technique where multiple models, often referred to as "weak learners," are trained to solve the same problem. These models are then combined in various ways to create a "strong learner," which performs better than individual models.

## Types of Ensemble Learning

1. **Bagging**: Bootstrap Aggregating involves training multiple instances of the same model on different subsets of the data.
2. **Boosting**: Focuses on training models sequentially, each correcting the errors of its predecessor.
3. **Stacking**: Combines predictions from multiple models using another machine learning model.

## Key Concepts

- **Diversity**: Ensuring that the models in the ensemble are diverse improves the overall performance.
- **Voting**: In classification problems, each model's prediction is considered a vote, and the final prediction is the one with the most votes.
- **Averaging**: In regression problems, the final prediction is the average of all individual predictions.

## Applications

- **Disease Detection**: Used in healthcare for more accurate diagnosis.
- **Financial Forecasting**: Used in finance to predict stock prices or market trends.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Used to improve the performance of language models.

## Advantages and Limitations

- **Robustness**: Ensemble methods are generally more robust and less prone to overfitting.
- **Computational Complexity**: Ensemble methods require more computational resources.
- **Interpretability**: They are often less interpretable than individual models.
