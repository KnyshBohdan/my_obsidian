Recurrent Neural Networks are a class of artificial neural networks designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data, such as text, genomes, handwriting, or spoken words. Unlike traditional feedforward neural networks, RNNs possess a form of internal memory that allows them to maintain state across sequences.

## Definition

A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is characterized by the presence of loops within the network, allowing information to persist. This enables RNNs to take into account the entire history of a sequence when making a prediction.

## How It Works

1. **Sequential Data**: RNNs are particularly useful for sequential data where the order of the elements is important.
2. **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)**: A specialized form of backpropagation used to update the network's weights.
3. **Hidden State**: Maintains information about previous steps in the sequence, aiding in future predictions.

### Key Concepts

- **Vanishing and Exploding Gradients**: Challenges in training RNNs due to the nature of sequential data.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: A special kind of RNN capable of learning long-term dependencies.
- **Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)**: A simplified version of LSTMs that often performs comparably.

## Applications

- **Natural Language Processing**: For tasks like machine translation and text summarization.
- **Speech Recognition**: For converting spoken language into text.
- **Time-Series Prediction**: For predicting stock prices or weather conditions.

## Challenges

- **Computational Complexity**: RNNs can be computationally intensive due to their recursive nature.
- **Difficulty in Capturing Long-Term Dependencies**: Traditional RNNs struggle with long sequences, often requiring more advanced architectures like LSTMs.
