Neural Networks are computational models inspired by the human brain's interconnected neuron structure. They are designed to recognize patterns and make decisions based on data. Neural Networks are the backbone of many machine learning algorithms and are particularly effective in tasks that are complex and data-intensive.

## Definition

A Neural Network consists of layers of interconnected nodes or "neurons." Each neuron performs a simple computation on its inputs, which are weighted sums of its previous layer's outputs. The result is then passed through an activation function to produce the neuron's output.

Output=f(âˆ‘iwixi+bias)

## How It Works

1. **Input Layer**: Receives raw input from the external environment.
2. **Hidden Layers**: Intermediate layers that process the inputs received.
3. **Output Layer**: Produces the final output based on the computations of the network.

### Key Concepts

- **Feedforward Networks**: Data flows in one direction, from input to output.
- **Backpropagation**: A learning algorithm that adjusts the weights based on the error of the network's output.
- **Activation Functions**: Functions like ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh that introduce non-linearity into the network.

## Types of Neural Networks

- **Feed-forward Neural Networks**: Simplest type, used in tasks like image recognition.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Have loops to allow information persistence, used in sequence prediction tasks.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Used in image recognition, have convolutional layers that automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features.

## Applications

- **Image Recognition**: Identifying objects, persons, or even actions in images.
- **Natural Language Processing**: For tasks like translation, summarization, and sentiment analysis.
- **Game Playing**: Used in AI that plays games like Chess and Go.

## Challenges

- **Overfitting**: When the network learns the training data too well, failing to generalize.
- **Computational Costs**: Neural networks, especially deep ones, require significant computational power.

## Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Machine Learning]]**: Neural Networks are a subset of machine learning algorithms.
- **[[Deep Learning]]**: Refers to neural networks with three or more layers.
- **[[Activation Functions]]**: Critical for introducing non-linearity into the network.
