Feedforward Neural Networks are a type of artificial neural network where the connections between nodes do not form a cycle. This architecture is in contrast to recurrent neural networks, which allow cycles within the network.

## Definition

A Feedforward Neural Network consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The data flows in one direction, from the input layer to the output layer, without any feedback loops.

$$Output=f(Hidden Layers(f(Input Layer)))$$

## How It Works

1. **Input Layer**: Receives the raw input data, typically in the form of a feature vector.
2. **Hidden Layers**: Comprise neurons that perform computations and transfer information to the next layer.
3. **Output Layer**: Produces the final output, which could be a class label in the case of classification or a real number in the case of regression.

### Key Concepts

- **Activation Functions**: Functions like ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh that introduce non-linearity into the network.
- **Backpropagation**: The algorithm used for minimizing the error in the network's predictions.
- **Loss Function**: A mathematical function that the network tries to minimize during training.

## Applications

- **Classification**: For tasks like image recognition and spam detection.
- **Regression**: For predicting a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables.
- **Function Approximation**: Can approximate unknown functions given sufficient data.

## Challenges

- **Overfitting**: The model may memorize the training data, leading to poor generalization.
- **Vanishing Gradient**: Occurs when the gradients of the loss function become too small for the network to learn effectively.
