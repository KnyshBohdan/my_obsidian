Convolutional Neural Networks are a category of neural networks that have proven very effective in areas such as image recognition and classification. CNNs have been successful in identifying faces, objects, and traffic signs apart from powering vision in robots and self-driving cars.

## Definition

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning algorithm that can recognize and interpret various aspects of visual data. It takes an input image and transforms it through a series of hidden layers, each of which is defined by a set of learnable parameters.

Output=f(Conv Layers,Activation Layers,Pooling Layers)
## How It Works

1. **Convolutional Layer**: The first layer that extracts features from the input image. Convolution preserves the spatial relationship between pixels.
2. **Activation Layer**: Introduces non-linearity into the system.
3. **Pooling Layer**: Reduces dimensionality.
4. **Fully Connected Layer**: Produces the final output.

### Key Concepts

- **Convolutional Kernels**: Small, learnable filters slide over the input image to produce feature maps.
- **Pooling**: Reduces the spatial dimensions (width & height) of the input volume.
- **Flattening**: Converts the 2D matrix data to a vector.

## Applications

- **Image and Video Recognition**: For identifying objects, persons, or even actions.
- **Medical Image Analysis**: For diagnosing diseases.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Although not traditional, CNNs are used in NLP tasks.

## Challenges

- **Computational Intensity**: CNNs require high-performance hardware.
- **Overfitting**: Especially when the network is excessively deep.
