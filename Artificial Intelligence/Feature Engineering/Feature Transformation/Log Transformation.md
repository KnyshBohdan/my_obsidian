## Definition

The Log Transformation is defined as:

x′=log⁡(x)

where x′ is the transformed value and xx is the original value. The base of the logarithm can vary, but the natural logarithm is commonly used.

## Importance

- **Normality**: Log Transformation is often used to make the data more normal, which is crucial for many statistical tests and machine learning algorithms.
- **Variance Stabilization**: It helps in stabilizing the variance across the dataset.
- **Outlier Handling**: The transformation can reduce the impact of outliers.

## Applications

- **Regression Analysis**: Used to meet the assumptions of linear regression models.
- **Biomedical and Psychosocial Research**: Widely used in these fields due to its ease of use.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Used to stabilize the variance across time.

## When to Use

Log Transformation is particularly useful when dealing with highly skewed distributions. It pulls back the tail part of the distribution, making it closer to a normal distribution.
