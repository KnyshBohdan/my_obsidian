Feature Transformation is the process of applying mathematical or computational operations to change the original feature variables into a new set of features, which are more suitable for modeling.

## Definition

Feature Transformation involves applying mathematical formulas to features to transform their values. It can be considered a subset of Feature Engineering, aiming to improve model performance. The transformation can be linear or non-linear and is often used to make the data fit a specific distribution, such as a normal distribution.

## Types of Transformations

1. **Function Transformers**: Apply a specific function to transform the data into a normal distribution. Common types include:
    
    - Log Transform
    - Square Transform
    - Square Root Transform
    - Reciprocal Transform
    - Custom Transform
2. **Power Transformers**: Apply a power to the data observations. Types include:
    
    - Box-Cox Transform
    - Yeo-Johnson Transform
3. **Quantile Transformers**: Transform features to follow a uniform or a normal distribution.
    

## Importance

- **Data Preprocessing**: Helps in making the data suitable for machine learning algorithms.
- **Model Performance**: Can improve the predictive power of the model.
- **Statistical Assumptions**: Helps in meeting the assumptions of certain statistical tests and machine learning models.

## Applications

- **Data Normalization**: In scaling features to a specific range.
- **Data Standardization**: In zero-centering the data and scaling to unit variance.
