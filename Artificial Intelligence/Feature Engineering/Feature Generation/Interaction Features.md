Interaction Features are derived from the combination of two or more original features, capturing the effect of their interaction on the target variable.

## Definition

An interaction feature is a new feature created by combining existing features in a way that captures their joint effect on the target variable. Mathematically, interaction features can be represented as:

Interaction Feature=f(xi,xj,…)

where ff is a function that combines the original features xi,xj,…

## Types of Interactions

1. **Pairwise Interactions**: Features interact in groups of 2. For example, BMI is defined as weight/height2weight/height2.
2. **Higher-Order Interactions**: More than 2 features interact, often seen in complex scientific relationships.

## Methods for Identifying Interactions

1. **Partial Dependence Plots (PDP)**: Visualize how 2 features vary with the predictions.
2. **Friedman's H-statistic**: Measures the strength of interactions between features.
3. **ANOVA**: Apply 2-way ANOVA method on all combinations of features and filter interactions based on F-statistics.

## Advantages and Limitations

- **Advantages**: Can capture complex relationships, improve model performance, and aid in interpretability.
- **Limitations**: Risk of overfitting, increases model complexity, and can be computationally expensive.

## Applications

- **Predictive Modeling**: Enhances the predictive power of classification and regression models.
- **Data Interpretation**: Helps in understanding the relationships between features.
