Semantic Segmentation is a computer vision task that involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class label, such as "dog," "vehicle," or "sky." Unlike object detection, which provides a bounding box around the object, semantic segmentation provides a pixel-wise classification.

## Definition

Semantic Segmentation is the process of assigning a class label to each pixel in an image. The goal is to create a segmentation map where each pixel is assigned a class label, effectively dividing the image into meaningful parts.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: An image is fed into the system.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are often used to extract features.
3. **Pixel Classification**: Each pixel is classified into one of the predefined classes.
4. **Output**: A segmentation map is generated, where each pixel is labeled with its corresponding class.

## Types of Algorithms

- **U-Net**: Primarily used for biomedical image segmentation.
- **SegNet**: Suitable for road and indoor scene segmentation.
- **FCN (Fully Convolutional Network)**: One of the pioneering methods in semantic segmentation.
- **DeconvNet**: Uses deconvolutional layers for upsampling.

## Examples

1. **Medical Imaging**: For segmenting different organs or detecting tumors.
2. **Autonomous Vehicles**: For understanding road scenes.
3. **Agriculture**: For crop health monitoring.

## Applications

- **Healthcare**: In MRI and CT scans.
- **Robotics**: For object manipulation.
- **Geo-Sensing**: For land cover classification.

## Properties

- **Pixel-level Classification**: Unlike object detection, semantic segmentation classifies each pixel.
- **Real-time Processing**: Important for applications like autonomous driving.
- **High Computational Load**: Due to the complexity of pixel-wise classification.
