Fast Style Transfer is an evolution of Neural Style Transfer (NST), a class of software algorithms that manipulate digital images or videos to adopt the appearance or visual style of another image. These algorithms use deep neural networks for image transformation, enabling the creation of artificial artwork from photographs by transferring the style of famous paintings to user-supplied photographs. Fast Style Transfer is particularly important for real-time applications and has been widely adopted in mobile apps and by artists for creating new artworks.

## Definition

Fast Style Transfer refers to the improved algorithms that perform NST more efficiently, often using a feed-forward network for speed. The process involves an input content image and a style reference image, which are then combined to produce a new image that retains the original content but displays the artistic style of the reference.

## Explanation

The original NST algorithm involves an iterative optimization process that adjusts the input image to minimize a loss function that measures the difference in content and style from the target images. Fast Style Transfer, however, uses a trained model that can apply the style transfer in a single forward pass, making it significantly faster. This is achieved by training a convolutional neural network on a set of images to learn the transformation that applies the artistic style to any new content image.

## Examples

An example of Fast Style Transfer would be taking a standard photo and applying the style of Van Gogh's "Starry Night" to it in real-time, resulting in a new image that looks as though Van Gogh had painted the scene himself.

## Properties

The main property of Fast Style Transfer is its speed, which allows for real-time image processing. This is a significant improvement over the original NST algorithms, which required iterative optimization and were computationally expensive.

## Applications

Fast Style Transfer has applications in various fields such as:

- Mobile applications for photo editing.
- Real-time video processing and editing.
- Creation of artistic content in digital media.
- Augmented reality (AR) applications.
