Image Classification is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims to categorize an entire image under a specific label. Unlike object detection, which involves classifying and locating multiple objects within an image, image classification typically pertains to single-object images.

## Definition

Image Classification is a supervised learning problem where the goal is to define a set of target classes and train a model to recognize them using labeled example photos. The model takes an image as input and outputs a label, identifying the primary subject or theme of the image.

## Key Concepts

### Types of Image Classification Models

1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: The most commonly used architecture for image classification tasks.
2. **Transfer Learning**: Leveraging pre-trained models to improve classification performance.
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple models to improve classification accuracy.

### Mathematical Foundations

- **Feature Maps**: Intermediate representations of the image, extracted by convolutional layers.
- **Activation Functions**: Non-linear functions applied to feature maps.
- **Loss Functions**: Functions like cross-entropy used to measure the difference between predicted and actual labels.

## Examples

1. **Face Recognition**: Classifying faces based on identity.
2. **Animal Classification**: Distinguishing between different species of animals.
3. **Scene Recognition**: Identifying the type of scene depicted in an image (e.g., beach, forest).

## Applications

- **Healthcare**: Classifying medical images for diagnostics.
- **Retail**: Automated tagging of product images.
- **Search Engines**: Powering image-based search functionalities.
