Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) is a keypoint detector and descriptor used in computer vision, particularly in the field of object recognition. Developed by Ethan Rublee, Vincent Rabaud, Kurt Konolige, and Gary R. Bradski in 2011, ORB is an efficient alternative to SIFT and SURF, which are patented algorithms. Its importance lies in its speed and performance, making it a popular choice for real-time applications.

## Definition

ORB is a fusion of the FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test) keypoint detector and the BRIEF (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features) descriptor with some modifications to enhance performance. ORB introduces an orientation component to FAST and computes oriented BRIEF features, which are robust to noise and rotation.

## Explanation

ORB operates by first detecting keypoints in an image using the FAST algorithm. It then uses a pyramid to detect keypoints at multiple scales, providing partial scale invariance. ORB assigns an orientation to each keypoint based on the intensity centroid, which is calculated using the moments of a patch around the keypoint. This orientation information allows ORB to compute rotation-invariant descriptors.

The BRIEF descriptor is then used to convert the keypoints into a binary feature vector, which is efficient for matching. ORB modifies BRIEF to be rotation-aware (rBRIEF), improving its performance under rotation.

## Examples

- Detecting and matching features between two images for object recognition or 3D reconstruction.
- Real-time tracking of objects in video sequences.
- Panorama stitching where features from multiple images are matched and aligned.

## Properties

- ORB is rotation invariant and partially scale-invariant.
- It is much faster than SIFT and SURF.
- ORB descriptors are binary vectors, which makes them efficient for computation and storage.

## Applications

ORB is used in various real-world scenarios such as augmented reality, robotics for navigation, and in mobile applications where computational resources are limited. It's also used in image stitching, 3D model building, and motion tracking.

## Connection to Other Topics

ORB is related to other feature detectors and descriptors such as:

- [[SIFT]]: ORB is often compared to SIFT as it provides similar robustness but is faster.
- [[SURF]]: Like SURF, ORB is used for real-time applications but without the patent restrictions.
