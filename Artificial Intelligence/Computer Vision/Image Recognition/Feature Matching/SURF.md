Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) is a robust local feature detector that is used in computer vision for tasks such as object recognition, image registration, and 3D reconstruction. It is known for being faster than other feature detectors like SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform), while maintaining robustness against various image transformations.

## Definition

SURF is an algorithm that identifies and describes interest points in images. Mathematically, it relies on the determinant of the Hessian matrix for point detection and the sum of Haar wavelet responses for point description.

## Explanation

SURF operates in three main steps: interest point detection using the determinant of the Hessian matrix, local neighborhood description with Haar wavelet responses, and feature matching. It uses integral images for speed and is known for its robustness to scale changes and rotations in the image.

## Examples

- Detecting features on an object for recognition: SURF can identify unique points on an object that can be found again under different viewing conditions.
- Image stitching: By finding matching features between images, SURF can be used to stitch images together into a panorama.

## Properties

- Speed: SURF is several times faster than SIFT due to the use of integral images.
- Robustness: It is more robust to image scaling and rotation.
- U-SURF: An upright version of SURF that is not rotation invariant but is faster, suitable for cases where the camera orientation is fixed.

## Applications

SURF is applied in various fields, including robotics (for navigation and object recognition), augmented reality (for tracking and overlaying digital images on real-world objects), and computer graphics (for creating 3D models from 2D images).

## Connection to Other Topics

- [[Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)]]: SURF is partly inspired by SIFT and shares similar applications but differs in speed and methodology.
- [[Object Recognition]]: SURF is commonly used for recognizing objects within images by detecting and describing local features.
- [[Image Registration]]: SURF features can be used to align different images of the same scene.
