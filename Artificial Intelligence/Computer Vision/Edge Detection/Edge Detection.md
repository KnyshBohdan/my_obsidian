Edge Detection is a fundamental operation in computer vision that identifies points in a digital image where there is a rapid change in intensity or color, effectively outlining the boundaries of objects within the image.

## Definition

Edge Detection is the process of identifying and locating sharp discontinuities in an image. These discontinuities usually correspond to the boundaries of objects, variations in illumination, or other significant changes in the visual field.

## Key Concepts

### Types of Edge Detection Algorithms

1. **Canny Edge Detector**: Known for its optimal error rate and computational efficiency.
2. **Sobel Operator**: Utilizes convolution with Sobel kernels for edge detection.
3. **Prewitt Operator**: Similar to Sobel but uses a different convolution kernel.

### Mathematical Foundations

- **Gradient Magnitude**: Measures the rate of change in intensity.
- **Edge Orientation**: The direction of the greatest rate of change.
- **Thresholding**: Determines what constitutes an edge based on gradient magnitude.

## Examples

1. **Medical Imaging**: Identifying boundaries of tumors.
2. **Robotics**: Object recognition and navigation.
3. **Video Surveillance**: Detecting movement by changes in edges.

## Applications

- **Image Segmentation**: Dividing an image into meaningful parts.
- **Object Recognition**: Identifying and classifying objects in images.
- **Image Enhancement**: Improving the quality of images for analysis.
