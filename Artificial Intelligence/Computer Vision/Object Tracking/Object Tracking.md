Object Tracking is a computer vision application that identifies and follows the movement of objects over time in a sequence of images or video frames. It extends object detection by not only identifying objects but also understanding their state and location across different frames.

## Definition

Object Tracking is the task of identifying and tracking the movement of objects in a sequence of images or video frames. It involves assigning a unique identification label to each detected object and then tracking its movement across subsequent frames.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: The first step involves providing a video or real-time feed from a camera.
2. **Object Detection**: An object detection algorithm classifies and detects the object by creating a bounding box around it.
3. **Labeling**: A unique identification label is assigned to each detected object.
4. **Tracking**: The algorithm keeps track of the object's movement through different frames, storing its relevant path information.

## Types of Algorithms

- **MDNet**: Multi-Domain Net leverages large-scale data for training and consists of pretraining and online visual tracking.
- **GOTURN**: Generic Object Tracking Using Regression Networks uses a regression-based approach.
- **ROLO**: Combines recurrent neural networks and YOLO for tracking.
- **DeepSORT**: An extension to Simple Online Real-time Tracker (SORT), which uses the Kalman filter for estimation.

## Examples

1. **Robotics**: Tracking robots in a warehouse.
2. **Surveillance**: Tracking intruders or vehicles.
3. **Sports**: Tracking players and the ball in sports analytics.

## Applications

- **Security Surveillance**: For identifying and tracking intruders.
- **Robotics**: For navigation and interaction with the environment.
- **Healthcare**: For tracking the movement of surgical instruments.
- **Transportation**: For tracking vehicles in real-time traffic management systems.

## Properties

- **Real-time Capability**: Many applications require real-time tracking.
- **Multi-object Tracking**: Some algorithms can track multiple objects simultaneously.
- **Accuracy**: The algorithm must be robust to occlusions, lighting changes, and other challenges.
