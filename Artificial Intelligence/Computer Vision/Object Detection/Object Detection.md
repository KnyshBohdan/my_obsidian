Object Detection is a computer vision technique that identifies and classifies objects within digital images or videos, and also specifies the location of each object by surrounding it with a bounding box.

## Definition

Object Detection involves identifying instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos. It not only classifies the object but also provides a bounding box around the object to indicate its location.

## How It Works

1. **Object Proposal**: Candidate bounding boxes are generated.
2. **Classification**: Each candidate box is classified into one of the object categories or as background.
3. **Bounding Box Regression**: The bounding box coordinates are fine-tuned for better localization.

## Types of Algorithms

- **Region Proposals**: R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, cascade R-CNN.
- **Single-Shot Detectors**: Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD), Retina-Net.
- **Others**: Deformable convolutional networks, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG).

## Examples

1. **Vehicle Counting**: Used in traffic management systems.
2. **Face Detection**: A subset of object detection, used in biometric systems.
3. **Activity Recognition**: Identifying actions or activities in surveillance footage.

## Applications

- **Security Surveillance**: For identifying and tracking intruders.
- **Retail**: For inventory management and customer behavior analysis.
- **Healthcare**: For detecting anomalies in medical images.
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: For detecting pedestrians and other vehicles.

## Properties

- **Real-time Processing**: Many applications require real-time detection.
- **Scalability**: Systems must be able to handle a large number of images.
- **Accuracy**: High accuracy is crucial, especially in critical applications.

## Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Object Localization]]**: Object Detection extends Object Localization by also classifying the object.
- **[[Computer Vision]]**: Object Detection is a subfield of computer vision.
- **[[Machine Learning]]**: Advanced algorithms are often based on machine learning techniques.
- **[[Image Recognition]]**: Object Detection can be seen as an advanced form of image recognition.
