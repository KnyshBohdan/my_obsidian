Eigenfaces are a set of eigenvectors used in the computer vision problem of human face recognition. This concept is significant as it provides a relatively low-dimensional space to represent face images, which is crucial for efficient recognition and classification. Eigenfaces are widely used in various fields, including security systems, digital image processing, and more recently, in social media for tagging and organizing photos.

## Definition

Eigenfaces are derived from the covariance matrix of the probability distribution over the high-dimensional vector space of face images. Mathematically, if X is a set of face images, and A is the mean image, the covariance matrix C is given by 
$$C = \frac{1}{N} \sum (X_i - A)(X_i - A)^T$$

where N is the number of images, and Xiâ€‹ is an image in the set. The eigenfaces are the eigenvectors of this covariance matrix.

## Explanation

Eigenfaces provide a method to decompose face images into a set of characteristic feature images, which are essentially the principal components of the set of faces. These components capture the variance in the images, representing the ways in which the faces differ from the mean face. By projecting a new face image onto this set of eigenfaces, we can record how the new face differs from the mean face, effectively reducing the dimensionality of the problem and enabling easier classification.

## Examples

For instance, if we have a training set of 100 face images, we can use principal component analysis to create a set of eigenfaces. Each new face can then be expressed as a weighted sum of these eigenfaces. For example, a face might be represented as 30% of eigenface 1, 50% of eigenface 2, and so on.

## Properties

The key properties of eigenfaces include:

- Dimensionality reduction: They reduce the dimensionality of the original face image space.
- Basis set: They form a basis for face images used to construct the covariance matrix.
- Variance representation: Each eigenface represents a direction in which the set of face images shows significant variance.

## Applications

Eigenfaces are applied in facial recognition systems, where they allow for quick and efficient identification and verification of individuals. They are also used in other pattern recognition systems, such as handwriting recognition, lip reading, and even medical imaging analysis.
