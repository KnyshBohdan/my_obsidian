3D facial recognition is a biometric technology that identifies individuals by analyzing the three-dimensional features of their faces. It is considered more accurate than 2D facial recognition because it is not affected by changes in lighting or facial expressions. This technology is crucial in various fields such as security, law enforcement, and personal device access.

## Definition

3D facial recognition is a technique that uses 3D sensors to capture information about the shape of a face. This information typically includes contours of the eye sockets, nose, and chin, which are then used to identify distinctive features on the surface of the face that are not dependent on lighting.

## Explanation

Unlike 2D recognition which relies on pictures, 3D facial recognition uses a 3D model to capture the facial structure. The geometry of the face is not as easy to alter or disguise as the skin's surface, making 3D recognition more effective in identifying individuals. It can also operate in low light and can recognize a subject at different angles, which is particularly useful in surveillance.

## Examples

- **Security Systems**: 3D facial recognition is used in security systems at airports and other sensitive areas to verify identities against known databases.
- **Smartphone Authentication**: Modern smartphones use 3D facial recognition for secure and convenient unlocking.
- **Forensics**: In forensics, 3D models of a face can be reconstructed from skeletal remains for identification purposes.

## Properties

- **Depth Perception**: 3D facial recognition systems measure the depth of a subject's features.
- **Pose Invariance**: These systems can recognize faces from a range of angles, not just head-on.
- **Expression Tolerance**: They are less likely to be fooled by facial expressions compared to 2D recognition.

## Applications

3D facial recognition is applied in various domains including:

- Personal device security
- Law enforcement and public safety
- Access control in secure facilities
- Immigration and border control
- Financial services for identity verification
