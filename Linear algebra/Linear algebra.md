## Definition

Linear Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with linear equations, linear maps, and their representations in vector spaces and matrices. It is central to almost all areas of mathematics and finds applications in various fields like engineering, physics, and computer science.

### Key Concepts

#### 1. Vector Spaces

A vector space over a field FF (often the field of real numbers) is a set VV equipped with two binary operations satisfying specific axioms. These include associativity, commutativity, identity element, inverse elements, and distributivity of scalar multiplication.

#### 2. Linear Maps

Linear maps are mappings between vector spaces that preserve the vector-space structure. A bijective linear map between two vector spaces is an isomorphism, and the kernel and range of a linear map are essential concepts.

#### 3. Subspaces, Span, and Basis

Linear subspaces are subsets of vector spaces that are themselves vector spaces. The span of a set of vectors forms a subspace, and a linearly independent spanning set is called a basis.

#### 4. Matrices

Matrices allow explicit manipulation of finite-dimensional vector spaces. They represent linear transformations and are essential tools in linear algebra.

### Examples

#### Vector Spaces

Consider the set of all real-valued functions; it forms a vector space over the real numbers.

#### Linear Maps

The derivative operator is a linear map from the vector space of differentiable functions to itself.

#### Matrices

A 2x2 matrix represents a linear transformation in two-dimensional space.

### Applications

Linear algebra is used in:

- Geometry for defining lines, planes, and rotations.
- Engineering for modeling natural phenomena.
- Computer Science for algorithms and simulations.
- Physics for expressing electromagnetic symmetries.

### Connections to Other Topics

- **Geometry**: Linear algebra is fundamental in modern presentations of geometry.
- **Functional Analysis**: It may be viewed as the application of linear algebra to spaces of functions.
- **Differential Geometry**: Linear algebra serves in tangent spaces to manifolds.
- **Abstract Algebra**: Generalizations of linear algebra concepts form part of abstract algebra.
