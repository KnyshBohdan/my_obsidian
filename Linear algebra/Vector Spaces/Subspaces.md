### Definition

In mathematics, and more specifically in linear algebra, a linear subspace or vector subspace is a vector space that is a subset of some larger vector space. A linear subspace is usually simply called a subspace when the context serves to distinguish it from other types of subspaces.

### Examples

#### Example I

In the vector space R3, take W to be the set of all vectors in R3 whose last component is 0. Then W is a subspace.

#### Example II

Let the field be R, but now let the vector space be the Cartesian plane. Take WW to be the set of points (x,y) of R2 such that y=0. Then W is a subspace.

#### Example III

Take the field to be R, but now let the vector space be the set of all functions from R to R. Let C(R) be the subset consisting of continuous functions. Then C(R) is a subspace.

#### Example IV

Keep the same field and vector space as before, but now consider the set Diff(R) of all differentiable functions. This is a subspace too.

### Properties of Subspaces

- Subspaces are nonempty and are closed under sums and under scalar multiples.
- Equivalently, subspaces can be characterized by the property of being closed under linear combinations.
- In a topological vector space, a finite-dimensional subspace is always closed.
- Descriptions of subspaces include the solution set to a homogeneous system of linear equations, the span of a collection of vectors, and the null space, column space, and row space of a matrix.
