In linear algebra, the dimension of a vector space is a fundamental concept that describes the number of vectors in any basis of the vector space over its base field. It provides insight into the structure of the space and is central to many theorems and properties.

### Definition

The dimension of a vector space V over a field F is the cardinality (i.e., the number of vectors) of a basis of V over its base field. It is sometimes referred to as the Hamel dimension or algebraic dimension. The dimension of the vector space over the field F can be denoted as dim⁡F(V) or $[V:F]$, read "dimension of V over F".

### Examples

- **Real Vector Space**: The vector space R3 has a standard basis, and therefore dimR​(R3)=3.
- **Complex Numbers**: The complex numbers C are both a real and complex vector space; we have dim⁡R(C)=2 and dim⁡C(C)=1. So the dimension depends on the base field.
- **Zero Dimension**: The only vector space with dimension 0 is the vector space consisting only of its zero element.

### Properties

- **Subspace Dimension**: If W is a linear subspace of V, then dim(W)≤dim(V).
- **Isomorphism**: Any two finite-dimensional vector spaces over F with the same dimension are isomorphic.
- **Rank-Nullity Theorem**: An important result about dimensions is given by the rank–nullity theorem for linear maps.
- **Field Extension**: The dimensions are related by the formula dimK​(V)=dimK​(F)dimF​(V). In particular, every complex vector space of dimension nn is a real vector space of dimension 2n.

### Generalizations

- **Matroid Dimension**: A vector space can be seen as a particular case of a matroid, and in the latter, there is a well-defined notion of dimension.
- **Trace of Identity Operator**: The dimension of a vector space may alternatively be characterized as the trace of the identity operator.

### Conclusion

The dimension of a vector space is a critical concept that provides insights into the structure and properties of the space. It has applications in various mathematical disciplines and is foundational to understanding linear algebra.
