Linear independence is a fundamental concept in linear algebra that plays a crucial role in understanding the structure of vector spaces. Here's an exploration of the concept of linear independence:

### Definition

A set of vectors v1,v2,…,vk​ in a vector space V is said to be linearly independent if there exist no nontrivial linear combination of the vectors that equals the zero vector. In other words, the vectors are linearly independent if the only solution to the equation a1v1+a2v2+⋯+akvk=0 is a1=a2=⋯=ak=0, where 0 denotes the zero vector.

### Examples

1. **Two Vectors**: The vectors uu and vv are linearly dependent if and only if one is a scalar multiple of the other.
2. **Three Vectors in R3**: The vectors v1=(1,1),v2=(−3,2),v3=(2,4) are linearly dependent, as one can be defined in terms of the others.

### Geometric Interpretation

- **Two Vectors**: Two vectors are linearly independent if they are not parallel to each other.
- **Three Vectors**: Three vectors are linearly independent if they do not belong to a common plane.

### Special Cases

- **Zero Vector**: If one or more vectors from a given sequence of vectors is the zero vector, then the vectors are necessarily linearly dependent.
- **Same Vector Twice**: If a sequence of vectors contains the same vector twice, it is necessarily dependent.

### Connection to Other Topics

- **[[Basis]]**: A set of vectors that is linearly independent and spans some vector space forms a basis for that vector space.
- **[[Dimension]]**: The definition of linear dependence and the ability to determine whether a subset of vectors in a vector space is linearly dependent are central to determining the dimension of a vector space.
- **[[Vector Spaces]]**: Linear independence is a property that vectors in a vector space may or may not satisfy.
- [[Linear algebra]]

### Conclusion

Linear independence is a property of vectors that ensures no vector in the set can be represented as a linear combination of the remaining vectors. It is a foundational concept in linear algebra, with applications in various mathematical and scientific fields.
