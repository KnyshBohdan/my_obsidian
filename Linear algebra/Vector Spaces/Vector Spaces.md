### Definition

A vector space (or linear space) is a collection of objects called vectors, which can be added together and multiplied by scalars (real or complex numbers). It must satisfy a set of specific axioms related to these operations.

### Key Concepts

#### 1. Axioms

A vector space must satisfy the following axioms:

- **Associativity of Addition**: (u+v)+w=u+(v+w)
- **Commutativity of Addition**: u+v=v+u
- **Identity Element**: There exists a zero vector 0 such that v+0=v for all v.
- **Inverse Elements**: For every vector vv, there exists an additive inverse −v−v such that v+(−v)=0.
- **Distributivity of Scalar Multiplication**: Scalar multiplication must be distributive with respect to vector addition and field addition.
- **Compatibility of Scalar Multiplication**: Scalar multiplication must be compatible with field multiplication.
- **Identity Element of Scalar Multiplication**: 1⋅v=v, where 1 denotes the multiplicative identity.

#### 2. Subspaces

A subspace of a vector space is a subset that is itself a vector space, satisfying the same axioms.

#### 3. Basis and Dimension

A basis of a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the space. The number of vectors in a basis is called the dimension of the vector space.

#### 4. Linear Independence

A set of vectors is linearly independent if no vector in the set can be expressed as a linear combination of the others.

### Examples

- The set of all real numbers forms a one-dimensional vector space over itself.
- The set of all ordered pairs of real numbers forms a two-dimensional vector space over the real numbers.

### Applications

Vector spaces are fundamental in mathematics and are used in:

- Geometry to define shapes and transformations.
- Physics to describe forces and motions.
- Engineering to model systems and structures.
