### Definition

In mathematics and physics, a vector is a term that refers to quantities that cannot be expressed by a single number (a scalar) or to elements of vector spaces. Historically, vectors were introduced in geometry and physics for quantities that have both magnitude and direction, such as displacements, forces, and velocity. Vectors can be geometric vectors, tuples, or elements of unspecified vector spaces.

### Key Concepts

#### 1. Geometric Vectors

Geometric vectors have magnitude (or length) and direction and are often represented by directed line segments or arrows.

#### 2. Vector Operations

Vectors can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and negated. These operations obey the familiar algebraic laws of commutativity, associativity, and distributivity.

#### 3. Vector Spaces

A vector space is a set equipped with vector addition and scalar multiplication that satisfy specific axioms. Examples include Euclidean vector space and coordinate vector space.

#### 4. Vector Types

- **Euclidean Vectors**: Represented by directed line segments.
- **Tuples**: Finite sequences of numbers of a fixed length.
- **Multivectors**: Elements of the exterior algebra of a vector space.

### Examples

- **Rotation Vector**: Whose direction is that of the axis of a rotation and magnitude is the angle of the rotation.
- **Probability Vector**: In statistics, a vector with non-negative entries that sum to one.

### Applications

Vectors play an essential role in various fields:

- **Physics**: Describing acceleration, forces, and other physical quantities.
- **Engineering**: Representing directions and magnitudes of various quantities.
- **Mathematics**: Forming the basis of vector spaces and linear algebra.
