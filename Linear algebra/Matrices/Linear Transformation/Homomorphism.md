A homomorphism is a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures of the same type, such as two groups, two rings, or two vector spaces. In linear algebra, homomorphisms of vector spaces are also called linear maps.

### Definition

A homomorphism is a map f:A→Bf:A→B between two algebraic structures AA and BB of the same type, equipped with the same structure, that preserves the operations of the structures. Formally, a map ff preserves an operation μμ of arity kk, defined on both AA and BB, if: f(μA(a1,…,ak))=μB(f(a1),…,f(ak)),f(μA​(a1​,…,ak​))=μB​(f(a1​),…,f(ak​)), for all elements a1,…,aka1​,…,ak​ in AA.

### Examples in Linear Algebra

1. **Linear Map**: A linear map between vector spaces is a homomorphism that preserves both the abelian group structure and scalar multiplication.
2. **Matrix Representation**: A function that maps real numbers to 2×2 matrices, defined by f(r)=(r00r)f(r)=(r0​0r​), is a homomorphism of rings, as it preserves both addition and multiplication.
3. **Exponential Function**: The exponential function x↦exx↦ex is a homomorphism between the group of real numbers under addition and the group of positive real numbers under multiplication.

### Special Homomorphisms

- **Isomorphism**: A bijective homomorphism that has an inverse that is also a homomorphism.
- **Endomorphism**: A homomorphism whose domain equals the codomain.
- **Automorphism**: An endomorphism that is also an isomorphism.
- **Monomorphism**: An injective homomorphism.
- **Split Monomorphism**: A homomorphism that has a left inverse.
