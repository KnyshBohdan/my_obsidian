In mathematics, an isomorphism is a structure-preserving mapping between two structures of the same type that can be reversed by an inverse mapping. Two mathematical structures are said to be isomorphic if an isomorphism exists between them. The term "isomorphism" is derived from the Ancient Greek words "isos" (equal) and "morphe" (form or shape).

### Definition

An isomorphism is a bijective function that preserves the structure of the objects it maps. Specifically, it must satisfy:

1. **Additivity**: The mapping preserves the addition operation.
2. **Multiplicativity**: The mapping preserves the multiplication operation.
3. **Invertibility**: There exists an inverse mapping that is also an isomorphism.

### Examples

1. **Logarithm and Exponential**: The logarithm function is an isomorphism that translates multiplication of positive real numbers into addition of real numbers. The exponential function is its inverse.
2. **Integers Modulo 6**: The group of integers modulo 6 is isomorphic to the direct product of integers modulo 2 and modulo 3.

### Types of Isomorphisms

- **Isometry**: An isomorphism of metric spaces.
- **Homeomorphism**: An isomorphism of topological spaces.
- **Diffeomorphism**: An isomorphism of spaces equipped with a differential structure.
- **Linear Isomorphisms**: Between vector spaces, specified by invertible matrices.
- **Group Isomorphisms**: Between groups.
- **Ring Isomorphism**: Between rings.
- **Field Isomorphisms**: Between fields.

### Properties

- **Automorphism**: An isomorphism from a structure to itself.
- **Canonical Isomorphism**: An isomorphism that is unique or more natural than other isomorphisms.
- **Relation-Preserving Isomorphism**: If one object consists of a set with a binary relation, an isomorphism preserves this relation.

### Applications

- **Algebra**: Isomorphisms are defined for all algebraic structures, including vector spaces, groups, rings, and fields.
- **Graph Theory**: An isomorphism between two graphs preserves the "edge structure."
- **Mathematical Analysis**: The Laplace transform is an isomorphism mapping differential equations into algebraic equations.
- **Cybernetics**: The "good regulator" theorem requires an isomorphism between the regulator and processing parts of a system.
