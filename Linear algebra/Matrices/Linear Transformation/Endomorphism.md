An endomorphism is a morphism (or structure-preserving transformation) from a mathematical object to itself. In the context of linear algebra, an endomorphism of a vector space VV is a linear map from VV to itself. It can be seen as a special case of a homomorphism where the domain and codomain are the same.

### Definition

An endomorphism is a function f:A→Awhere AA is an algebraic structure, and ff preserves the structure of A. In linear algebra, an endomorphism of a vector space VV is a linear map f:V→V

### Properties

- **Composition**: The composition of any two endomorphisms of X is again an endomorphism of X.
- **Monoid Structure**: The set of all endomorphisms of an object forms a monoid, known as the full transformation monoid, and denoted End(X).
- **Endomorphism Ring**: Any two endomorphisms of an abelian group can be added together, and with multiplication defined as function composition, the endomorphisms form a ring known as the endomorphism ring.

### Examples

- **Orthogonal Projection**: An orthogonal projection onto a line is a linear operator on the plane and an example of an endomorphism that is not an automorphism.
- **Matrix Representation**: The set of endomorphisms of Zn is the ring of all n×nn×n matrices with integer entries.
- **Operator Theory**: In concrete categories like vector spaces, endomorphisms can be interpreted as unary operators acting on the elements.

### Special Cases

- **Automorphism**: An invertible endomorphism is called an automorphism.
- **Endofunction**: An endofunction is a function whose domain is equal to its codomain. A homomorphic endofunction is an endomorphism.
