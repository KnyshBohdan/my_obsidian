Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are fundamental concepts in linear algebra, with wide-ranging applications in various fields including physics, engineering, and computer science. Here's a comprehensive overview:

### Introduction

In linear algebra, an eigenvector of a linear transformation is a nonzero vector that changes at most by a constant factor when that linear transformation is applied to it. The corresponding eigenvalue, often represented by λ, is the multiplying factor. Geometrically, a transformation matrix rotates, stretches, or shears the vectors it acts upon. The eigenvectors for a linear transformation matrix are the set of vectors that are only stretched, with no rotation or shear. The eigenvalue is the factor by which an eigenvector is stretched.

### Formal Definition

If T is a linear transformation from a vector space V over a field F into itself and vv is a nonzero vector in V, then vv is an eigenvector of T if T(v)=λv, where λ is a scalar in F, known as the characteristic value or characteristic root associated with vv.

### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of Matrices

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be defined using matrices. If A is an n×n matrix, the eigenvalue equation for A is: Av=λv where v is an eigenvector and λ is the corresponding eigenvalue.

### Eigenvalues and the Characteristic Polynomial

The eigenvalues of a matrix A are values of λ that satisfy the equation: det⁡(A−λI)=0 where II is the identity matrix. This equation is called the characteristic equation, and the polynomial on the left-hand side is the characteristic polynomial.

### Applications

- **Stability Analysis**: Used to analyze the stability of various systems.
- **Vibration Analysis**: In mechanical engineering, to study vibrations.
- **Facial Recognition**: In computer science, for pattern recognition.
- **Matrix Diagonalization**: To simplify the study of linear transformations.

### Example

Consider the matrix: 
$$ A = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \ 1 \\ 1\ 2\end{bmatrix}$$
The characteristic polynomial is: 
$$det(A - \lambda I) = \begin{bmatrix} 2 - \lambda \ 1 \\ 1 \ 2 - \lambda\end{bmatrix}$$
The eigenvalues are λ=1 and λ=3.
