#### Definition

Cholesky Decomposition is a method used in linear algebra to decompose a Hermitian, positive-definite matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose. The decomposition can be represented as: A=LL∗A=LL∗ where LL is a lower triangular matrix with real positive diagonal entries, and L∗L∗ is the conjugate transpose of LL.

#### Example

For the matrix A=[412−161237−43−16−4398]A=⎣

⎡​412−16​1237−43​−16−4398​⎦⎤​ the Cholesky decomposition yields L=[200610−853]L=⎣⎡​26−8​015​003​⎦

#### Key Concepts

- **Hermitian Matrix**: A matrix that is equal to its own conjugate transpose.
- **Positive Definite**: A matrix is positive definite if all its eigenvalues are positive.
- **Lower Triangular Matrix**: A matrix where all the entries above the main diagonal are zero.

#### Applications

- **Solving Linear Equations**: Cholesky decomposition is used to solve systems of linear equations, particularly when the coefficient matrix is symmetric and positive definite.
- **Optimization**: Used in various optimization algorithms.
- **Statistical Computations**: Applied in multivariate statistical methods.

#### Algorithm

1. **Check for Positive Definiteness**: Ensure that the matrix is Hermitian and positive definite.
2. **Decompose**: Decompose the matrix into a lower triangular matrix LL.
3. **Compute Conjugate Transpose**: Compute the conjugate transpose L∗L∗ of LL.
