Systems of linear equations are a collection of linear equations involving the same set of variables. They are a fundamental part of linear algebra and have applications in various fields such as physics, engineering, economics, and computer science. Here's an exploration of the topic:

## Definition


### Methods of Solving 
1. **Elimination of Variables**: This method involves solving one equation for one variable and then substituting this expression into the remaining equations, reducing the system to a single linear equation. 
2. **Row Reduction (Gaussian Elimination)**: This method represents the system as an augmented matrix and then uses elementary row operations to reach reduced row echelon form. 
3. **Cramer's Rule**: An explicit formula for the solution using determinants. It's more theoretical and not often used for large matrices due to computational complexity. 
4. **Matrix Solution**: If the coefficient matrix is square and has full rank, the system has a unique solution given by  $\mathbf{x} = A^{-1}\mathbf{b}$, where  $A^{-1}$  is the inverse of the matrix. 
5. **Iterative Methods**: For very large systems, iterative methods like the Gradient Descent can be used to find an approximate solution. 
### Special Cases 
- **Homogeneous System**: A system where all constant terms are zero. Every homogeneous system has at least one solution, known as the trivial solution. 
- **Inconsistent System**: A system that has no solution. 
- **Dependent and Independent Equations**: The rank of the augmented matrix and the coefficient matrix plays a crucial role in determining the nature of the solution. 
### Examples 
Consider the following system: $\begin{align*} x + 3y - 2z & = 5 \\ 3x + 5y + 6z & = 7 \\ 2x + 4y + 3z & = 8 \end{align*}$ Solving this system using Gaussian elimination or other methods, we can find the solution $(x,y,z)=(-15,8,2)$
