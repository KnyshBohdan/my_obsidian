A one-tailed test, also known as a directional test, is used when the researcher is interested in testing the statistical significance in one specific direction of the relationship between variables.

## Definition

- **One-Tailed Test**: A hypothesis test in which the values that reject the null hypothesis are located entirely in one tail of the probability distribution. It tests for the possibility of the relationship in one specific direction only.

## Types

- **Right-Tailed Test**: Tests if the population parameter is greater than the value specified in the null hypothesis.
- **Left-Tailed Test**: Tests if the population parameter is less than the value specified in the null hypothesis.

## Usage

- **When to Use**: A one-tailed test is used when the research question or hypothesis specifies a direction of interest (e.g., greater than or less than).
- **Example**: If you want to test whether a new drug is more effective than the existing one, a right-tailed test would be appropriate.

## Comparison with Two-Tailed Test

- **Sensitivity**: A one-tailed test is more sensitive to detecting an effect in the specified direction compared to a two-tailed test.
- **Significance Level (Î±)**: In a one-tailed test, the entire significance level (e.g., 5%) is in one tail, whereas in a two-tailed test, it is divided between two tails.

## Connections to Other Topics

- **[[P-Value]]**: The p-value in a one-tailed test is calculated based on the probability in the specified tail, reflecting the directionality of the test.
- **[[Significance Level (alpha)]]**: The significance level in a one-tailed test is entirely in one tail, affecting the rejection region and the power of the test.
- **[[Two-Tailed Test]]**: The one-tailed test is contrasted with the two-tailed test, which does not specify a direction and tests for the possibility of a relationship in both directions.

## Limitations and Challenges

- **Choice of Direction**: The choice of direction must be justified by the research question or hypothesis. An incorrect choice can lead to misleading results.
- **Potential Bias**: If the true effect is in the opposite direction of the specified tail, a one-tailed test may fail to detect it.
