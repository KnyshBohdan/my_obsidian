The p-value is a fundamental concept in statistical hypothesis testing, particularly in null hypothesis significance testing. It represents the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the ones observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct.

## Definition

- **P-Value**: The probability under the null hypothesis of obtaining a real-valued test statistic at least as extreme as the one obtained. It quantifies the statistical significance of a result.

## Interpretation

- **Significance Level (α)**: The p-value is compared to a predefined threshold value (α), commonly set to 0.05. If the p-value is less than or equal to α, the null hypothesis is rejected.
- **Two-Sided Test**: The p-value can be calculated for one-sided or two-sided tests, depending on the nature of the hypothesis being tested.

## Usage

- **Statistical Hypothesis Testing**: The p-value is widely used in statistical hypothesis testing to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.
- **Misuse and Misinterpretation**: Despite its widespread use, the p-value is often misunderstood and misused. It does not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true or the importance of a result.

## Connections to Other Topics

- **[[Hypothesis Testing]]**: The p-value is a critical component in hypothesis testing, used to quantify the evidence against the null hypothesis.
- **[[Significance Level (alpha)]]**: The significance level is the threshold against which the p-value is compared to determine statistical significance.
- **[[Type I Error]]**: Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true (based on the p-value) leads to a Type I error.

## Historical Background

- **American Statistician Association (ASA) Statements**: The ASA has made formal statements regarding the interpretation and usage of p-values, emphasizing that they do not measure the probability that the hypothesis is true.

## Limitations and Challenges

- **Misinterpretation**: The p-value is often misunderstood as being the probability that the null hypothesis is true, leading to incorrect conclusions.
- **Debate on Alternatives**: Some statisticians have proposed focusing more on other inferential statistics, such as confidence intervals or Bayes factors, but there is heated debate on these alternatives.
