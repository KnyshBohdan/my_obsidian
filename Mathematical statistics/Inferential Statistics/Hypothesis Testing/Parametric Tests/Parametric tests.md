Parametric statistics is a branch of statistics that assumes that sample data comes from a population that can be adequately modeled by a probability distribution with a fixed set of parameters. Here's a comprehensive overview:

### Definition

Parametric tests are based on specific assumptions about the parameters of the population distribution from which the samples are drawn. These tests are used when the underlying population distribution is known or assumed to follow a certain distribution, such as the normal distribution.

### Example

Consider a sample of 99 test scores with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 1. If we assume all 99 test scores are random observations from a normal distribution, then we can predict there is a 1% chance that the 100th test score will be higher than 102.33 (the mean plus 2.33 standard deviations). Parametric statistical methods are used to compute this value.

### Assumptions

Parametric tests typically require the following assumptions:

- **Distribution**: The data follows a known distribution (e.g., normal distribution).
- **Scale**: The scale of measurement is interval or ratio.
- **Homogeneity of Variance**: The variance within each group being compared is the same.
- **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other.

### Types of Parametric Tests

Some common parametric tests include:

- **Z-Test**: Used when the population variance is known.
- **t-Test**: Used when comparing means.
- **F-Test**: Used to compare variances.
- **ANOVA**: Used to compare means across multiple groups.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Advantages**: Generally more powerful and provide more information about the parameters of interest.
- **Disadvantages**: The assumptions may not always be met, leading to incorrect conclusions.

### Connections to Other Topics

- **Non-Parametric Tests**: These do not assume an explicit mathematical form for the distribution and typically involve fewer assumptions of structure and distributional form.
- **Likelihood-Ratio Tests, Wald Tests, Score Tests**: These are specific types of parametric tests.
