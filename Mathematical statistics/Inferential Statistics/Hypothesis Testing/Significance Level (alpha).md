The significance level, denoted by αα, is a threshold used in statistical hypothesis testing to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis. It represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true, leading to a Type I Error.

## Definition

- **Significance Level (αα)**: The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis, given that the null hypothesis is true.
- **P-Value**: The probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme, given that the null hypothesis is true.
- **Statistical Significance**: A result is statistically significant if the p-value is less than or equal to αα.

## Common Values

The significance level for a study is chosen before data collection and is typically set to 5% or much lower, depending on the field of study.

## Role in Hypothesis Testing

In a two-tailed test, the rejection region for a significance level of α=0.05α=0.05 is partitioned to both ends of the sampling distribution, making up 5% of the area under the curve. The rejection region can be allocated to one side of the sampling distribution in a one-tailed test or partitioned to both sides in a two-tailed test.

## Historical Background

- **18th Century**: Statistical significance dates back to the work of John Arbuthnot and Pierre-Simon Laplace.
- **1925**: Ronald Fisher advanced the idea of statistical hypothesis testing, suggesting a probability of 0.05 as a convenient cutoff level.
- **1933**: Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson called this cutoff the alpha level and recommended that it be set ahead of time.

## Limitations and Challenges

- **Practical vs. Statistical Significance**: A statistically significant result may not necessarily be practically significant.
- **Reproducibility**: A statistically significant result may not be easy to reproduce.
- **Misuse and Overuse**: There has been criticism and debate over the reliance on significance testing and the threshold of α=5%α=5%.
