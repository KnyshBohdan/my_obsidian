In statistical hypothesis testing, a Type II Error is the failure to reject a null hypothesis that is actually false. This error is also known as a "false negative" finding or conclusion.

## Definition

A Type II Error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, but the statistical test fails to reject it. In terms of a courtroom analogy, a Type II Error corresponds to acquitting a criminal.

## Mathematical Background

In statistical test theory, the notion of a statistical error is an integral part of hypothesis testing. The test goes about choosing between two competing propositions, denoted by H0H0​ (null hypothesis) and H1H1​ (alternative hypothesis). If the result of the test does not correspond with reality, then an error has occurred. There are two types of error:

- **Type I Error**: Mistaken rejection of a true null hypothesis (false positive).
- **Type II Error**: Mistaken failure to reject a false null hypothesis (false negative).

## Consequences

The consequence of a Type II Error depends on the size and direction of the missed determination and the circumstances. For example, an expensive cure for one in a million patients may be inconsequential even if it truly is a cure, but the failure to detect it would be a Type II Error.

## Example

Consider a study where researchers compare a drug with a placebo. If the patients who got the drug did not get better at a higher rate than the ones who got the placebo, but this was a random fluke, that would be a Type II Error.

## Crossover Error Rate

The crossover error rate (CER) is the point at which Type I Errors and Type II Errors are equal. A system with a lower CER value provides more accuracy than a system with a higher CER value.

## Tradeoffs

The Type II Error rate is denoted by the Greek letter ββ and is related to the power of a test, which equals 1−β1−β. These two types of error rates are traded off against each other: for any given sample set, the effort to reduce one type of error generally results in increasing the other type of error.
