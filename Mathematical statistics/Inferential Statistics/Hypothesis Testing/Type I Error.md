In statistical hypothesis testing, a Type I Error is the incorrect rejection of a true null hypothesis. This error is also known as a "false positive" finding or conclusion.

## Definition

A Type I Error occurs when the null hypothesis is true, but the statistical test incorrectly rejects it. In terms of a courtroom analogy, a Type I Error corresponds to convicting an innocent person.

## Mathematical Background

In statistical test theory, the notion of a statistical error is an integral part of hypothesis testing. The test goes about choosing between two competing propositions, denoted by H0H0​ (null hypothesis) and H1H1​ (alternative hypothesis). If the result of the test does not correspond with reality, then an error has occurred. There are two types of error:

- **Type I Error**: Mistaken rejection of a true null hypothesis (false positive).
- **Type II Error**: Mistaken failure to reject a false null hypothesis (false negative).

## Consequences

The consequence of a Type I Error depends on the context of the test and the potential impact of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis. For example, in medical testing, a Type I Error may lead to a patient being treated for a disease they do not have, potentially exposing them to harmful treatments.

## Example

Consider a legal trial where the null hypothesis is that the defendant is innocent, and the alternative hypothesis is that the defendant is guilty. A Type I Error would occur if the jury convicts an innocent person.

## Significance Level

The probability of making a Type I Error is denoted by the Greek letter αα, known as the significance level. It is often set at 0.05 or 0.01, representing a 5% or 1% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.

## Tradeoffs

The Type I Error rate is traded off against the Type II Error rate. For any given sample set, the effort to reduce one type of error generally results in increasing the other type of error.

## Real-World Applications

Type I Errors are common in various fields, including:

- **Medical Testing**: False positives in medical screening can lead to unnecessary treatments.
- **Security Screening**: False alarms in airport security screening.
- **Spam Filtering**: Legitimate emails wrongly classified as spam.
