The F-test is a statistical hypothesis test in which the test statistic follows an F-distribution under the null hypothesis. It is widely used in various statistical contexts, and its applications can be broadly categorized as follows:

### Common Examples of F-Tests

1. **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)**: Testing the hypothesis that the means of several normally distributed populations, all having the same standard deviation, are equal.
2. **Lack-of-Fit Test**: Testing the hypothesis that a proposed regression model fits the data well.
3. **Nested Models**: Testing the hypothesis that a data set in regression analysis follows the simpler of two proposed linear models that are nested within each other.
4. **F-Test of Equality of Variances**: Testing the hypothesis that two populations have the same variance.

### Formula and Calculation

Most F-tests arise by considering a decomposition of the variability in a collection of data in terms of sums of squares. The F-statistic is the ratio of two scaled sums of squares reflecting different sources of variability. The formula for the one-way ANOVA F-statistic is: 
$$F = \frac{between-group-variability}{within-group-variability}$$
​where the between-group variability and within-group variability are calculated based on the sum of squares of differences from the means.

### Multiple-Comparison ANOVA Problems

The F-test in one-way ANOVA is used to assess whether the expected values of a quantitative variable within several pre-defined groups differ from each other. It can be used as an "omnibus" test to detect any of several possible differences without needing to pre-specify which groups are to be compared.

### Regression Problems

The F-test can be used to compare two nested models, where one model is 'nested' within the other. The F-statistic for this comparison is given by: 
$$F = \frac{\frac{RSS_1 - RSS_2}{p_2 - p_1}}{\frac{RSS_2}{n - p_2}}$$
​where RSS is the residual sum of squares of the model, and pp is the number of parameters.

### Sensitivity to Non-Normality

The F-test is sensitive to non-normality, and alternative tests like Levene's test, Bartlett's test, and the Brown–Forsythe test may be used in the context of ANOVA.

### Connections to Other Topics

- **Goodness of Fit**: The F-test is related to assessing the fit of statistical models.
- **Nonparametric Tests**: In cases where normality assumptions are not met, nonparametric alternatives might be considered.
