Nonparametric statistics represent a branch of statistics that is not restricted by assumptions concerning the nature of the population from which a sample is drawn. Unlike parametric statistics, nonparametric methods do not rely on specific distributional assumptions such as normality or specified parameters like mean or variance. Here's an overview of nonparametric tests:

### Definition

Nonparametric statistics can be defined in two main ways:

1. **Distribution-Free Methods**: Techniques that do not rely on data belonging to any particular parametric family of probability distributions.
2. **Flexible Model Structure**: Techniques that do not assume that the structure of a model is fixed. The model grows in size to accommodate the complexity of the data.

### Key Concepts

1. **Ranking**: Non-parametric methods are often used for data that have a ranked order, such as ordinal data.
2. **Robustness**: These methods are more robust as they make fewer assumptions.
3. **Simplicity**: Often simpler to use, even when parametric methods are justified.
4. **Statistical Power**: Non-parametric tests may require a larger sample size to achieve the same degree of confidence as parametric tests.

### Methods

Some of the most frequently used nonparametric inferential statistical methods include:

- **Kolmogorov–Smirnov test**: Tests whether a sample is drawn from a given distribution.
- **Mann–Whitney U test**: Tests whether two samples are drawn from the same distribution.
- **Wilcoxon signed-rank test**: Tests whether matched pair samples are drawn from populations with different mean ranks.
- **Kruskal–Wallis one-way analysis of variance**: Tests whether more than two independent samples are drawn from the same distribution.
- **Kendall's tau**: Measures statistical dependence between two variables.
- **Spearman's rank correlation coefficient**: Measures statistical dependence using a monotonic function.

### Applications and Purpose

- **Studying Ranked Data**: Such as movie reviews or preferences.
- **Robust Analysis**: When less is known about the application or when assumptions of parametric tests are violated.
- **Nonparametric Regression**: Modeling the relationship between variables non-parametrically.

### Connections to Other Topics

- **Parametric Statistics**: Nonparametric methods provide an alternative when parametric assumptions are not met.
- **Robust Statistics**: Nonparametric methods are considered part of robust statistical techniques.
- **Machine Learning**: Techniques like support vector machines with Gaussian kernels are considered nonparametric.
