The G-test is a statistical test used for testing the goodness of fit of observed values to expected ones according to a given model. It is often used in the context of contingency tables and is related to the chi-squared test. Here's a detailed overview:

### Definition

The G-test is based on the likelihood ratio, and it measures how well observed frequencies match expected frequencies specified by a model. It is used in various contexts, including testing for independence in contingency tables and testing goodness of fit.

### Formula

The G-test statistic is calculated as: 
$$G = 2 \sum_{i} O_i ln(\frac{O_i}{E_i})$$
where Oi is the observed frequency, and Ei is the expected frequency for the i-th category.

### Assumptions

The G-test assumes that the expected frequencies are known or can be estimated from the data, and that the observations are independent.

### Applications

- **Goodness of Fit**: The G-test can be used to test how well a sample fits a specific distribution.
- **Contingency Tables**: It is often applied to test for independence or association in contingency tables.
- **Comparing Two Proportions**: The G-test can be used to compare two proportions, similar to the chi-squared test.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Advantages**: The G-test is often more accurate than the chi-squared test, especially when expected frequencies are small.
- **Disadvantages**: Interpretation can be more complex, and it may be less familiar to some practitioners.

### Connections to Other Topics

- **Chi-Squared Test**: The G-test is related to the chi-squared test and can be used in similar contexts.
- **Goodness-of-Fit Tests**: The G-test is a type of goodness-of-fit test.
- **Nonparametric Tests**: The G-test is considered a nonparametric test.
