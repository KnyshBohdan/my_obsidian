A Two-Tailed Test is a statistical test used to determine if a parameter is equal to a specific value. Unlike a one-tailed test, where the critical region is entirely within one tail of the distribution, a two-tailed test divides the critical region between both tails.

## Definition

In a Two-Tailed Test, the null hypothesis H0H0​ is typically stated as equality (e.g., μ=μ0μ=μ0​), and the alternative hypothesis H1H1​ is that the parameter is not equal to the specified value (e.g., μ≠μ0μ=μ0​).

## Process

1. **State the Hypotheses**: The null hypothesis is that the parameter is equal to a specific value, and the alternative hypothesis is that it is not equal.
2. **Choose the Significance Level**: Select a significance level (αα), often 0.05 or 0.01.
3. **Calculate the Test Statistic**: Depending on the test, this might follow a specific distribution like the t-distribution or normal distribution.
4. **Determine the Critical Region**: The critical region is divided equally between the two tails of the distribution. If the test statistic falls in either tail, the null hypothesis is rejected.
5. **Make a Decision**: Reject the null hypothesis if the test statistic falls in the critical region.

## Example

Suppose you want to test whether a coin is fair. The null hypothesis is that the probability of heads is 0.5, and the alternative hypothesis is that it is not 0.5. A two-tailed test would be appropriate here, as you are interested in deviations in either direction from 0.5.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

- **Advantages**: More conservative and less likely to make a Type I Error.
- **Disadvantages**: Less powerful than a one-tailed test for detecting an effect in a specific direction.

## Connections to Other Topics

- [[Hypothesis Testing]]: Two-Tailed Test is a specific method within Hypothesis Testing.
- [[Type I Error]]: It is related to the concept of Type I Error, as the significance level determines the probability of making this error.
- [[Type II Error]]: It is also related to the concept of Type II Error, as the power of the test (1 - Type II Error rate) is affected by whether the test is one-tailed or two-tailed.
