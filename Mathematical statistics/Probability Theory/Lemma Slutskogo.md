Slutsky's Theorem is a fundamental result in probability theory that extends some properties of algebraic operations on convergent sequences of real numbers to sequences of random variables.

## Statement

Let Xn​ and Yn​ be sequences of scalar/vector/matrix random elements. If Xn​ converges in distribution to a random element X, and Yn converges in probability to a constant cc, then the following holds:

The requirement that YnYn​ converges to a constant is essential; if it were to converge to a non-degenerate random variable, the theorem would no longer be valid.
