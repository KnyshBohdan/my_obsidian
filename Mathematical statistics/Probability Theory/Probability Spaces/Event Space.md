The Event Space, or Sample Space, in probability theory, is the set of all possible outcomes or results of an experiment or random trial. It is usually denoted using set notation, and the possible ordered outcomes, or sample points, are listed as elements in the set. Common labels for a sample space include S, Ω, or U (for "universal set").

## Definition

A sample space may be finite, countably infinite, or uncountably infinite. A subset of the sample space is an event, denoted by EE. If the outcome of an experiment is included in E, then event E has occurred.

### Examples

- Tossing a single coin: {H,T}, where H means heads and T means tails.
- Tossing two coins: {HH,HT,TH,TT}.
- Rolling a six-sided die: {1,2,3,4,5,6}.

## Conditions of a Sample Space

A set ΩΩ with outcomes s1,s2,…,sn must meet some conditions to be a sample space:

1. **Mutually Exclusive**: If sj​ occurs, then no other sisi​ will take place.
2. **Collectively Exhaustive**: On every experiment, there will always take place some outcome si∈Ω.
3. **Right Granularity**: The sample space must have the right granularity depending on what the experimenter is interested in. Irrelevant information must be removed, and the right abstraction must be chosen.

## Multiple Sample Spaces

For many experiments, there may be more than one plausible sample space available, depending on what result is of interest to the experimenter.

## Equally Likely Outcomes

Some treatments of probability assume that the various outcomes of an experiment are always defined so as to be equally likely. However, there are experiments that are not easily described by a sample space of equally likely outcomes.

## Infinitely Large Sample Spaces

In an elementary approach to probability, any subset of the sample space is usually called an event. However, this gives rise to problems when the sample space is continuous, so a more precise definition of an event is necessary.
