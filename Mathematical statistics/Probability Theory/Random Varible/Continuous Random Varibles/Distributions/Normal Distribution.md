The Normal Distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable. It is one of the most important and widely used distributions in probability and statistics.

## Definition

The general form of the probability density function (pdf) of the Normal Distribution is given by:

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma})^2}$$

Where:

- μ: Mean of the distribution (also the median and mode).
- σ: Standard deviation.
- $σ^2$: Variance.

### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

The CDF is given by:

$$F(x) = \frac{1}{2} [1 + erf (\frac{x - \mu}{\sigma \sqrt{2}})]$$
## Properties

- **Mean**: μ
- **Median**: μ
- **Mode**: μ
- **Variance**: $σ^2$
- **Skewness**: 0
- **Excess Kurtosis**: 0
- **Entropy**: $\frac{1}{2}ln⁡(2πσ^2)+1/2$

## Standard Normal Distribution

The standard normal distribution is a special case when μ=0 and σ=1. It is described by:

$$\varphi (z) = \frac{e^{-z^2/2}}{\sqrt{x \pi}}$$

## Applications

Normal distributions are essential in statistics and are often used in natural and social sciences to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known. They are valuable due to properties like the central limit theorem, which states that the average of many samples of a random variable with finite mean and variance converges to a normal distribution.
