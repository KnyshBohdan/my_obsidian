Continuous Random Variables are a type of random variable that can take on an uncountably infinite number of possible values. Unlike discrete random variables, which have a countable number of outcomes, continuous random variables can take on any real value within a given range.

## Definition

A continuous random variable is defined by a probability density function (pdf) that describes the relative likelihood of any given value within its range.

### Probability Density Function (pdf)

The pdf is a function whose value at any given sample in the sample space can be interpreted as providing a relative likelihood that the value of the random variable would equal that sample. The probability that the random variable falls within a specific interval can be found by integrating the pdf over that interval.

### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

The CDF describes the probability that the random variable is no larger than a given value. It is the integral of the pdf from negative infinity to the given value.

## Properties

- **Support**: The set of values that can be assumed with non-zero probability by the random variable.
- **Mean**: The weighted average of the possible values, using their probabilities as their weights.
- **Median**: The value such that the set of values less than the median, and the set greater than the median, each have probabilities no greater than one-half.
- **Mode**: For an absolutely continuous random variable, a value where the pdf is relatively high.
- **Tail**: The regions close to the bounds of the random variable, where the pdf is relatively low.

## Examples of Continuous Random Variables

- **Normal Distribution**: Also known as the Gaussian distribution, it is a commonly encountered absolutely continuous probability distribution.
- **Uniform Distribution**: All values within a given range have an equal probability of occurrence.
- **Exponential Distribution**: Models the time between events in a Poisson process.
