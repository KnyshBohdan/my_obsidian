Variance is a statistical measure that describes the spread or dispersion of a set of data points or values. It quantifies how far the numbers in the data set are from the mean and each other.

## Definition

The variance of a random variable XX with mean μμ is defined as:

$$Var(X) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \mu)^2}{n}$$

For a population, nn is the total number of values, and for a sample, the denominator is n−1.

## Interpretation

Variance measures the degree to which each number is different from the mean and thus from every other number in the set. A variance of 0 indicates that all the values are identical, while a high variance indicates that the values are spread out.

## Properties

- **Non-negative**: Variance is always non-negative, as it's based on the squared differences.
- **Units**: The units of variance are the square of the units of the original data.
- **Sensitivity**: Variance is sensitive to outliers, as it squares the differences.

## Standard Deviation

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and provides a measure of spread that is in the same units as the data.

$$\sigma = \sqrt{Var(X)}$$
