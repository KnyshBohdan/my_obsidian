A Discrete Random Variable is a random variable that has a countable number of possible values. The values can be finite or countably infinite. Discrete random variables are used to model scenarios where the outcomes are distinct and separate.

## Definition

A random variable X is called a discrete random variable if there is a countable set of real numbers {an} such that:

$$P(X = a_n) > 0 \ for \ all \ n \ and \ P(X \in \{a_n\}) = 1$$

The function that assigns probabilities to the values of the random variable is called the Probability Mass Function (PMF).

## Examples

### Number of Children

A random variable representing the number of children in a family is a discrete random variable, as it can take on non-negative integer values.

### Roll of a Die

The outcome of rolling a fair six-sided die is a discrete random variable, as it can take on one of six distinct values.

## Probability Mass Function (PMF)

The PMF of a discrete random variable X is given by:

$$p_X(x) = P(X = x)$$

for all xx in the range of X.

## Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

The CDF of a discrete random variable is given by:

$$F_X(x) = P(X \le x) = \sum_{a_n \le x}p_X(a_n)$$

## Properties

- **Countable Values**: Discrete random variables take on a countable number of values.
- **PMF**: The PMF assigns probabilities to individual outcomes.
- **Relationship to Other Random Variables**: Discrete random variables can be related to continuous random variables, random vectors, random functions, and other mathematical structures.
