The Discrete Uniform Distribution is a symmetric probability distribution wherein a finite number of values are equally likely to be observed. In other words, every one of the values has an equal probability of 1/n​.

## Definition

The Discrete Uniform Distribution is often denoted by U{a,b} or unif{a,b}, where aa and b are integers with b≥a, and n=b−a+1.

### Probability Mass Function (PMF)

The PMF is given by:

$$1/n$$

### Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

The CDF is expressed as:

$$\frac{[k] - a + 1}{n}$$

### Mean

The mean of the distribution is:

$$\frac{a + b}{2}$$

### Variance

The variance is given by:

$$\frac{n^2 - 1}{12}$$

### Entropy

The entropy of the distribution is:

$$\ln(n)$$

## Examples

### Throwing a Fair Die

A simple example of the discrete uniform distribution is throwing a fair die. The possible values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and each time the die is thrown, the probability of a given score is 1/6​.

### Random Permutation

A random permutation generated uniformly from the permutations of a given length is another example of a discrete uniform distribution.

## Properties

- **Symmetry**: All values in the distribution are equally likely.
- **Non-parametric Nature**: The distribution itself is inherently non-parametric, but it is convenient to represent its values generally by all integers in an interval $[a,b]$.
- **Applications**: It has applications in various fields, including the estimation of maximum (e.g., the German tank problem) and random permutation generation.
