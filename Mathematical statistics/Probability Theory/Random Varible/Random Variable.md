A Random Variable (RV) is a variable whose possible values are numerical outcomes of a random phenomenon. It's a function that assigns a real number to each outcome in the sample space of a random experiment.

## Definition

A Random Variable X is defined as a function:

X:Ω→RX

where Ω is the sample space of the experiment, and RR is the set of real numbers.

## Types of Random Variables

### Discrete Random Variable

A Discrete Random Variable has a countable number of possible values. The probability distribution of a discrete random variable is given by a probability mass function (PMF).

### Continuous Random Variable

A Continuous Random Variable has an uncountable number of possible values. The probability distribution of a continuous random variable is described by a probability density function (PDF).

## Expectation and Variance

- **Expectation**: The expected value or mean of a random variable XX is denoted by E(X)E(X) and is defined as the weighted average of all possible values.
- **Variance**: The variance of a random variable XX is denoted by Var(X)Var(X) and measures the dispersion of the random variable around its mean.
