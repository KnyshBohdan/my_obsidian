Correlation or dependence is any statistical relationship, whether causal or not, between two random variables or bivariate data. It usually refers to the degree to which a pair of variables are linearly related.

## Definition

### Pearson's Correlation Coefficient

The most familiar measure of dependence between two quantities is the Pearson's correlation coefficient, defined as:

​$$\rho_{X,Y} = \frac{cov(X, Y)}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y} = \frac{E[(X - \mu_X)(Y - \mu_Y)]}{\sigma_X \sigma_Y}$$

where E⁡ is the expected value operator, cov⁡cov means covariance, and σXσX​ and σYσY​ are the standard deviations of X and Y, respectively.

### Rank Correlation Coefficients

Rank correlation coefficients, such as Spearman's rank correlation and Kendall's rank correlation coefficient, measure the extent to which, as one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase, without requiring that increase to be represented by a linear relationship.

## Properties

- **Range**: The value of a correlation coefficient ranges between −1 and +1.
- **Independence**: If the variables are independent, Pearson's correlation coefficient is 0, but the converse is not true.
- **Sensitivity**: Pearson's correlation is sensitive only to a linear relationship between two variables, while other correlation coefficients are more robust to nonlinear relationships.

## Examples

- **Height and Offspring**: There is a correlation between the height of parents and their offspring.
- **Price and Demand**: The correlation between the price of a good and the quantity the consumers are willing to purchase is depicted in the demand curve.
- **Weather and Electricity Demand**: An electrical utility may produce less power on a mild day based on the correlation between electricity demand and weather.
