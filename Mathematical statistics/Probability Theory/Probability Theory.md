Probability Theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the analysis of random phenomena. It provides the foundational framework for quantifying uncertainty and making predictions about random events. Probability Theory is essential in various fields, including statistics, finance, gambling, science, artificial intelligence, and more.

## Overview

Probability Theory is concerned with the modeling of events and the analysis of their likelihood. It provides the tools to describe complex systems and make predictions about future occurrences based on observed data.

### Key Concepts

- **Experiment**: A procedure that can be repeated under the same conditions and leads to well-defined outcomes.
- **Sample Space**: The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
- **Event**: A specific outcome or a set of outcomes from the sample space.
- **Probability**: A numerical measure that quantifies the likelihood of an event, ranging from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).
